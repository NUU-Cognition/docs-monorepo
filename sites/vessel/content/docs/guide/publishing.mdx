How to configure vessels, reference content, handle media, and control visibility.

## Vessel Definitions

A vessel definition is a markdown file that declares what to publish and how. It follows the naming convention:

```
(Vessel) Name.md
```

The file contains a YAML configuration block inside a fenced code block:

```markdown
# My Documentation

Description of this vessel.

​```yaml
template: project
visibility: public

content:
  - [Getting Started Guide](/getting-started-guide)
  - [API Reference](/api-reference)
  - [Architecture Overview](/architecture-overview)

options:
  title: "Acme Docs"
  subtitle: "Developer documentation for the Acme platform"
  status: active
​```
```

### Required Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `template` | Template to render with: `blog`, `project`, or `whitepaper` |
| `visibility` | Access level: `public`, `unlisted`, or `private` |

### Optional Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `content` | Array of `[wikilink](/wikilink)` references to include |
| `options` | Template-specific configuration (see template references) |
| `homepage` | Homepage layout options (template-dependent) |

The H1 heading becomes the vessel's display name. The paragraph before the YAML block becomes the description.

## Content References

Use wikilinks to reference other markdown files in your workspace:

```yaml
content:
  - [Document Title](/document-title)
  - [Subfolder/Another Document](/subfolder-another-document)
```

Wikilinks match by document title (case-insensitive). At publish time, the CLI resolves each link to the actual file, reads its content and frontmatter, and bundles it into the vessel.

## Content Frontmatter

Individual content files can include YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: Custom Display Title
date: 2026-01-15
author: Jane Smith
tags:
  - engineering
  - architecture
description: A brief summary for listings
---

# Your content here
```

Which fields are used depends on the template. Blog uses `date`, `author`, and `tags`. Project and whitepaper templates use `tags` for badge display. All templates use `title` as a display name override.

### Slug Generation

Content URLs are derived from filenames:
- `My First Post.md` → `/my-first-post`
- Lowercase, spaces become hyphens, special characters removed

## Media

Images and other media referenced in your content are automatically uploaded when you publish.

### Supported Syntax

```markdown
![Alt text](path/to/image.png)
```

```html
<img src="path/to/image.png">
```

```markdown
![image.png](/image-png)
```

All three formats work. Obsidian embeds (`![...](/)`) are converted to standard markdown.

### How It Works

1. The CLI scans your content for media references
2. Files are resolved relative to the content file, then relative to the workspace root
3. Files are uploaded to cloud storage
4. Local paths are rewritten to CDN URLs in the published content

External URLs (`https://...`) are left unchanged.

### Supported Formats

Images (PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG, WebP), video (MP4, WebM), audio (MP3, WAV), and PDF.

## Visibility

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `public` | Anyone can view. Appears in listings and search. |
| `unlisted` | Accessible via direct URL only. Not indexed. |
| `private` | Requires authentication. Only publisher members can view. |

## Publishing & Unpublishing

```bash
# Publish a specific vessel
vessel publish "My Blog"

# Publish all vessels in workspace
vessel publish --all

# Publish under a specific publisher
vessel publish "Docs" --publisher acme-labs

# Remove a published vessel
vessel unpublish my-blog-slug
```

Publishing is a full replace — every publish uploads all content and media fresh. There are no partial updates or diffs.

## Template Options

Each template accepts different `options`. See the full references:

- [Reference - Blog Options](/templates/blog-options) — dates, authors, featured posts, sorting, sidebar
- [Reference - Project Options](/templates/project-options) — status, milestones, updates, scope, sections with icons
- [Reference - Whitepaper Options](/templates/whitepaper-options) — audience variants, table of contents, timeline, version badges
