NUU Vessel turns your markdown workspace into a hosted website. You write content locally, define what to publish in a simple YAML file, and deploy with a single command.

## Install the CLI

```bash
pnpm add -g @nuucognition/vessel-cli
```

Requires Node.js 18+.

## Login

```bash
vessel login
```

Opens your browser to authenticate. Once complete, you're ready to publish.

## Create a Publisher

Publishers are the namespace for your vessels — they appear in the URL as `/v/{publisher}/{vessel}`.

```bash
vessel publishers create
```

Follow the prompts to set a display name and slug (e.g., `acme-labs`).

## Create a Vessel

Create a file named `(Vessel) My Blog.md` in your workspace:

```markdown
# My Blog

A personal engineering blog.

​```yaml
template: blog
visibility: public

content:
  - [My First Post](/my-first-post)
  - [Second Post](/second-post)

options:
  title: "My Blog"
  showDates: true
​```
```

The YAML block tells Vessel which template to use, what content to include (via `[wikilinks](/wikilinks)` to other markdown files), and how to configure the template.

## Publish

```bash
vessel publish "My Blog"
```

The CLI bundles your content, uploads media, and deploys. Your vessel is live at:

```
https://vessel.nuucognition.com/v/{publisher}/{vessel-slug}
```

## Templates

Vessel ships with three templates, each designed for a different content type:

| Template | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| **blog** | Posts, articles, newsletters — chronological content with dates, authors, and tags |
| **project** | Project pages — status tracking, milestones, updates, scope, and section-based documentation |
| **whitepaper** | Long-form documents — audience-based content variants, table of contents, version timeline |

Each template has its own `options` — see the template references for full configuration:

- [Reference - Blog Options](/templates/blog-options)
- [Reference - Project Options](/templates/project-options)
- [Reference - Whitepaper Options](/templates/whitepaper-options)
