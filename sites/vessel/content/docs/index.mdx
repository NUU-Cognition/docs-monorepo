Vessel is a publishing layer for markdown workspaces. You write content locally in your Flint, declare what to share through a simple definition file, and publish with a single command. The web gets a rendered view. Your content stays where it is.

Most publishing tools ask you to move your content somewhere else — a CMS, a hosting platform, a separate authoring environment. Vessel doesn't. It treats publication as a *projection* of your existing notes, not a migration.

## The Core Idea

A vessel is a view of your workspace, published to the web.

You define it in a single markdown file: which notes to include, which template to use, and how to configure the presentation. The CLI reads that definition, bundles the referenced content, and deploys a rendered website. When your content changes, you publish again. The definition stays in your workspace alongside everything else.

This is declarative publishing. You describe what you want published. Vessel handles the rendering, hosting, and delivery.

## Why This Approach

**Your content stays local.** Vessel reads from your workspace at publish time. It doesn't own your content, sync it to a database, or require you to edit in a web interface. Your files stay as markdown on your machine, versioned with git, editable in any tool.

**No build system.** There's no static site generator to configure, no build pipeline to maintain, no framework to keep updated. You define a vessel, run `vessel publish`, and the site is live. Templates handle the presentation.

**One source of truth.** The vessel definition is a markdown file in your workspace. It links to other markdown files in your workspace. There's no separate config repository, no dashboard state, no out-of-sync deployment. Everything is files you can read and edit.

**Templates, not themes.** Vessel templates aren't cosmetic skins — they're purpose-built rendering engines for specific content types. A blog template understands chronological posts, featured articles, and reading time. A project template understands milestones, status tracking, and scope. A whitepaper template understands audience variants and version timelines. You pick the template that matches your content type, and it handles the rest.

## How It Works

### Vessel Definitions

A vessel definition is a markdown file named `(Vessel) Name.md` that contains a YAML configuration block:

```yaml
template: blog
visibility: public

content:
  - [First Post](/first-post)
  - [Second Post](/second-post)

options:
  title: "My Blog"
  showDates: true
```

The `content` field uses wikilinks to reference other files in your workspace. At publish time, the CLI resolves those links, reads the content, and bundles everything together.

The `options` field is template-specific. Each template defines what it accepts — the blog template takes `showDates` and `featured`, the project template takes `milestones` and `status`, the whitepaper template takes `sections` with audience variants.

### Templates

Vessel ships with three templates:

**Blog** — Chronological posts with dates, authors, tags, featured articles, search, and sidebar navigation. For teams publishing engineering blogs, changelogs, or newsletters.

**Project** — A project homepage with status badge, section-based documentation, milestone timeline, update feed, scope tracking, and external links. For open source projects, internal tools, or product pages.

**Whitepaper** — Long-form structured documents with a dual-view homepage (continuous paper view and section grid), audience-based content variants, table of contents, and version timeline. For technical papers, RFCs, or documentation that serves multiple audiences.

Templates are opinionated. They make layout, navigation, and typography decisions so you don't have to. You configure them through `options` — you don't build them from scratch.

### Publishing

Publishing is a single command:

```bash
vessel publish "My Blog"
```

The CLI:
1. Reads the vessel definition
2. Resolves all content references (wikilinks → actual files)
3. Uploads media (images, PDFs) to cloud storage
4. Deploys the vessel to its public URL

Publishing is a full replace every time. There are no diffs, no partial updates, no merge conflicts. The latest publish is the truth.

Your vessel is live at `vessel.nuucognition.com/v/{publisher}/{vessel-slug}`.

### Publishers

Publishers are namespaces. They appear in the URL and group related vessels together. A personal publisher might hold your blog and portfolio. A team publisher might hold documentation and project pages.

You create a publisher once, then publish vessels under it. Multiple people can publish under the same publisher for team collaboration.

## What Vessel Is Not

**Not a CMS.** There's no web editor, no content management interface, no approval workflows. You edit markdown files locally and publish from the command line.

**Not a static site generator.** There's no build step you manage, no framework configuration, no plugin ecosystem to navigate. Vessel is a hosted service — you publish content, it renders pages.

**Not a design tool.** You don't customize CSS, choose fonts, or arrange layouts. Templates handle presentation. You configure them through structured options, not code.
