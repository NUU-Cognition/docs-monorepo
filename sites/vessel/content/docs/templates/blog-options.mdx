  title: "My Engineering Blog"
  description: "Thoughts on software and systems"
  sidebar: false
  showDates: true
  showAuthor: true
  showReadTime: true
  featured: "welcome-post"
  sortBy: "date"
  sortDirection: "desc"
  listDetail: "date"
```

## Display Options

### `title`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Default:** Vessel name

Override the blog title shown on the homepage. If omitted, the vessel's `name` field is used.

### `description`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Default:** Vessel description

Override the blog description shown below the title on the homepage. If omitted, the vessel's `description` field is used.

### `sidebar`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `true`

Show a sidebar with post navigation when viewing individual posts. On desktop, the sidebar is a fixed panel on the left. On mobile, it collapses into a slide-out sheet menu.

When `false`, individual posts render in a clean single-column layout.

### `showDates`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `true`

Show dates on individual post pages and featured cards. Reads from the `date` frontmatter field on each content file.

### `showAuthor`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `true`

Show author attribution on individual post pages. Reads from the `author` frontmatter field on each content file.

### `showReadTime`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `true`

Show estimated reading time on individual post pages and featured cards. Calculated automatically from content length (~200 words per minute).

---

## Featured Post

### `featured`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Default:** none

Title or slug of a post to feature as a hero card at the top of the homepage. The featured post is displayed in a bordered card above the post list with its excerpt (if the post has an `excerpt` frontmatter field).

When searching, the featured card is hidden and the featured post appears in the filtered results.

---

## Sorting

### `sortBy`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Default:** none (default order)

Frontmatter field name to sort posts by in the list. Can also be set to `"title"` to sort alphabetically by post title.

The sort is type-aware: if the field values are parseable as dates, they're compared chronologically. Otherwise, they're compared as strings using locale-aware ordering.

Common values: `"date"`, `"title"`, `"order"`, `"author"`

### `sortDirection`

- **Type:** `"asc"` | `"desc"`
- **Default:** `"desc"`

Sort direction. Use `"desc"` for newest-first date sorting or reverse alphabetical, `"asc"` for oldest-first or A-Z.

Only takes effect when `sortBy` is set.

---

## Post List

### `listDetail`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Default:** `"date"`

Frontmatter field to display on the right side of each post row in the homepage list. The value is auto-formatted: date strings are displayed as short dates (e.g., "Jan 5, 2025"), other values are shown as-is.

Set to `""` (empty string) to hide the detail column entirely.

Common values: `"date"`, `"author"`, `"category"`, `""`

---

## Content File Frontmatter

Blog posts can include any frontmatter fields. The fields below are recognized by the template:

| Field | Type | Used by |
|-------|------|---------|
| `date` | `string` (ISO date) | `showDates`, `sortBy`, `listDetail` |
| `author` | `string` | `showAuthor`, `listDetail` |
| `excerpt` | `string` | Featured card description |
| Any custom field | `string` or `number` | `sortBy`, `listDetail` |
