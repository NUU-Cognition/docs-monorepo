## Homepage Views

The whitepaper homepage has two views, toggled via a segmented control:

- **Full Paper** (default) — Renders all section content in sequence as a single continuous document. When audience variants are available, an audience selector appears allowing readers to switch between General and audience-specific content for each section.
- **Sections** — Grid of section cards for browsing. Clicking a card navigates to the individual section page.

The view toggle appears automatically when there are sections with content.

---

## Display Options

### `title`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Default:** Vessel name

Override the whitepaper title shown on the homepage and in navigation. If omitted, the vessel's `name` field is used.

### `subtitle`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Default:** none

Subtitle displayed below the title on the homepage.

### `sidebar`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `true`

Show a sidebar with section navigation when viewing individual sections. On desktop, the sidebar is a fixed panel on the left. On mobile, it collapses into a slide-out sheet menu.

When `false`, individual sections render in a clean single-column layout with a fixed back arrow in the top-left corner.

### `showVersionBadges`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `true`

Show version badges on section cards and section headers. Reads from the `version` field on each section.

---

## Abstract

### `abstract`

- **Type:** `string`
- **Default:** none

Markdown content for the abstract section displayed on the homepage below the links and above the view toggle. Supports full markdown including wiki links.

---

## Links

### `links`

- **Type:** `array`
- **Default:** `[]`

External links displayed as pill buttons right below the title/subtitle on the homepage. Each link opens in a new tab.

#### Link Object

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `label` | `string` | Yes | Button text |
| `url` | `string` | Yes | Link URL |
| `icon` | `string` | No | Icon name (see icon list below) |

#### Available Icons

`target`, `code`, `users`, `book`, `book-open`, `file-text`, `github`, `discord`, `message`, `globe`, `link`, `mail`, `settings`, `shield`, `zap`, `star`, `home`, `package`, `layers`, `database`, `terminal`, `palette`, `heart`, `lightbulb`, `rocket`, `map`

---

## Sections

### `sections`

- **Type:** `array`
- **Default:** `[]`

Ordered list of whitepaper sections. Each section appears as a card in the sections grid and as a navigable page. In the full paper view, sections are rendered in order as a continuous document.

#### Section Object

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | `string` | Yes | URL slug for the section (e.g., `"design"`) |
| `title` | `string` | Yes | Display title |
| `content` | `string` | No | Default content — wiki link reference (e.g., `"[Design Principles](/design-principles)"`) |
| `audiences` | `array` | No | Audience-specific content variants (see below) |
| `description` | `string` | No | Short description shown on the homepage card and full paper view |
| `version` | `string` | No | Version badge (e.g., `"v1.0"`) |
| `updated` | `string` | No | Updated date badge (e.g., `"Feb 2026"`) — displayed as an outline badge on cards and headers |
| `external` | `string` | No | External URL — section links out instead of showing internal content |

When `external` is set, the section card links to that URL in a new tab and is excluded from prev/next navigation and the full paper view.

When `content` is set to a `[Title](/title)` wiki link, the template matches it against published mesh documents by title and renders the matched document's content.

Tags from the matched content document's frontmatter are displayed as badges in the top right of the section title.

#### Audience Variant Object

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `audience` | `string` | Yes | Audience name (e.g., `"Developers"`, `"Operators"`) |
| `content` | `string` | Yes | Wiki link to audience-specific content (e.g., `"[Design - Developer Focus](/design-developer-focus)"`) |

Audience variants allow the same section to have different content for different readers. In the full paper view, the audience selector switches between variants. When a variant exists for the selected audience, its content is shown; otherwise the section falls back to the default `content`.

**Example:**

```yaml
- id: architecture
  title: Architecture
  content: [Architecture Overview](/architecture-overview)           # General audience (default)
  audiences:
    - audience: Developers
      content: [Architecture Deep Dive](/architecture-deep-dive)       # More technical detail
    - audience: Operators
      content: [Architecture - Ops Runbook](/architecture-ops-runbook)   # Operations-focused
```

---

## Timeline

### `showTimeline`

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `true`

Show the version timeline on the homepage below the content views.

### `timeline`

- **Type:** `array`
- **Default:** `[]`

Chronological entries for the version timeline.

#### Timeline Entry Object

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `version` | `string` | Yes | Version label (e.g., `"v1.0"`) |
| `date` | `string` | Yes | ISO date string (e.g., `"2026-02-01"`) |
| `summary` | `string` | Yes | Brief description of what changed |
| `link` | `string` | No | Section ID (e.g., `"architecture"`) or external URL (e.g., `"https://..."`) |
| `linkLabel` | `string` | No | Custom link text (defaults to `summary`) |

Dates are displayed as short format (e.g., "Feb 2026").

When `link` is set, the summary text becomes a clickable link. If `link` starts with `http`, it opens in a new tab as an external link. Otherwise it's treated as a section ID and links to that section within the vessel. Use `linkLabel` to show different text than the summary.

## Content File Frontmatter

Section content documents can include any frontmatter fields. The fields below are recognized by the template:

| Field | Type | Used by |
|-------|------|---------|
| `tags` | `string[]` | Displayed as badges next to the section title |
