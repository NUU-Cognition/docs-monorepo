Common issues and how to resolve them.

## Quick Diagnostics

When something isn't working:

```bash
# Check you're in a Flint
flint --version

# See current state
flint plugin list
flint workspace list

# Repair common issues
flint repair --dry-run
```

## Common Issues

### "Not a Flint workspace"

**Symptom:** Commands fail with "Not a Flint workspace" or similar.

**Causes:**
- Not in a `(Flint)` folder
- Missing `flint.toml`
- Corrupted `.flint/` directory

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Check current directory
pwd
ls -la

# Should see:
# - flint.toml
# - .flint/
# - Mesh/

# If flint.toml missing, you're in the wrong folder
cd "(Flint) Your Project"

# If .flint/ corrupted
flint repair
```

### Missing File IDs

**Symptom:** Files don't appear in index or have `id: undefined`.

**Solution:**

```bash
# Re-index to add IDs
flint sync

# Or specifically rebuild the index
flint index
```

### Plugin Not Working

**Symptom:** Plugin commands fail or agent doesn't recognize plugin.

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Check if installed
flint plugin list

# If not listed, add to flint.toml and sync
# [plugins]
# required = ["plugin-name"]
flint sync

# If listed but not working, update all plugins
flint plugin update
```

For agents: Make sure to read the plugin's init file first:
```
@Plugins/PluginName/init-shorthand.md
```

### Configuration Out of Sync

**Symptom:** Changes to `flint.toml` not reflected.

**Solution:**

```bash
flint sync
```

This reads `flint.toml` and updates installed plugins, mods, and state.

### Broken Links

**Symptom:** `[Note](/note)` links don't resolve or show as broken.

**Solutions:**

Common causes:
1. Typo in link - fix the spelling
2. Note renamed - update links manually
3. Note deleted - remove or update references

Check what notes exist by browsing `Mesh/` or using Obsidian's graph view.

### Git Conflicts in .flint/

**Symptom:** Git shows conflicts in `.flint/` files.

**Solution:**

`.flint/` should be gitignored. If you're seeing conflicts:

```bash
# Remove from git tracking
git rm -r --cached .flint/

# Ensure .gitignore has the entry
echo ".flint/" >> .gitignore

# Regenerate
flint sync
```

### Workspace References Missing

**Symptom:** Workspace references show as "missing".

**Causes:**
- Path doesn't exist on this machine
- Path changed
- Different machine than where reference was created

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check references
flint workspace list

# Re-fulfill with correct path
flint workspace fulfill <name> /correct/path

# Or remove if no longer needed
flint workspace remove <name>
```

### Export Compilation Fails

**Symptom:** Export build produces errors.

**Common causes:**

1. **Missing notes:**
   ```
   Error: Note not found: [Missing Note](/missing-note)
   ```
   Fix: Create the note or remove the reference from the export manifest.

2. **Circular transclusions:**
   ```
   Error: Circular reference detected
   ```
   Fix: Remove the circular embed chain.

3. **Invalid output path:**
   ```
   Error: Cannot write to output
   ```
   Fix: Check the Exports/ folder exists.

**Building exports:**

```bash
# List available exports
flint export list

# Build a specific export
flint export build guide
```

### Index Corruption

**Symptom:** Queries return wrong results or missing files.

**Solution:**

```bash
# Delete and rebuild index
rm -rf .flint/index/
flint sync
```

### Frontmatter Parsing Errors

**Symptom:** Files not indexed or showing parse errors.

**Common causes:**

1. **Invalid YAML:**
   ```yaml
   ---
   tags: #tag    # Wrong - needs quotes or array
   ---
   ```
   Fix:
   ```yaml
   ---
   tags:
     - "#tag"
   ---
   ```

2. **Missing closing `---`:**
   ```markdown
   ---
   id: abc

   # Content  # Missing closing ---
   ```

3. **Tabs instead of spaces:**
   YAML requires spaces. Check for tab characters.

### Performance Issues

**Symptom:** Commands are slow.

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Check Mesh size
find Mesh -name "*.md" | wc -l

# If very large (1000+), consider:
# 1. Archiving old content
# 2. Using more specific organization

# Clear and rebuild index
rm -rf .flint/
flint sync
```

### CLI Not Found

**Symptom:** `flint: command not found`

**Solutions:**

Reinstall via the install script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NUU-Cognition/flint/main/install.sh | bash
```

If still not found, check your PATH:

```bash
# Check if the binary exists
ls -la ~/.nuucognition/flint/

# Add to PATH if needed
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

## Repair Command

`flint repair` fixes many common issues automatically:

```bash
# Preview what would be fixed
flint repair --dry-run

# Apply fixes
flint repair
```

**What it fixes:**
- Missing standard folders (Mesh/, Exports/, etc.)
- Invalid lock file
- Missing flint.toml
- Missing .gitignore
- Missing registry entries

## Resetting a Flint

If all else fails, you can reset runtime state:

```bash
# Remove all generated state (keeps your notes)
rm -rf .flint/

# Remove plugins (keeps notes)
rm -rf Plugins/

# Regenerate everything
flint sync
```

**Warning:** This removes:
- Index (will be rebuilt)
- Plugin status (plugins will need re-initialization)
- Lock file (will be regenerated)

Your notes in `Mesh/` are preserved.
