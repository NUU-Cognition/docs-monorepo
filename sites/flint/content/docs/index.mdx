Flint is a local-first workspace framework for structured thinking. It provides a simple but powerful way to organize your notes, connect them to external resources, and collaborate with AI agents.

At its heart, Flint is a folder structure with conventions. But these conventions create something greater: a cognitive workspace where your ideas live as interconnected markdown files, navigable by both humans and AI.

## Who Is Flint For?

**Developers** managing complex projects. If you're building software and need to keep track of architecture decisions, implementation notes, and project plans alongside your code, Flint gives you a structured home for that thinking.

**Researchers** organizing knowledge. If your work involves connecting ideas across sources, building understanding over time, and producing written outputs, Flint provides the framework to capture and evolve your thinking.

**AI-assisted workflows**. If you collaborate with AI agents (Claude, ChatGPT, or local models), Flint gives them the context they need to be genuinely helpful. Your agent can read the init file, understand the workspace structure, and get to work without lengthy explanations.

**Anyone** who wants their notes to be more than a pile of files. Flint turns scattered documents into a connected knowledge graph with clear organization.

## The Local-First Philosophy

Your data stays on your machine. A Flint is just a folder - plain markdown files in a sensible structure. There is no cloud service, no proprietary database, no vendor lock-in.

This means:

- **You own your data.** Move it, back it up, version it with git, sync it however you want.
- **It works offline.** No internet required. Your workspace is always available.
- **It's future-proof.** Markdown files will be readable in 50 years. Proprietary formats won't.
- **It's inspectable.** You can open any file in any text editor and see exactly what's there.

## Core Concepts

### Mesh: Your Thinking Space

The `Mesh/` folder is where your notes live. Every markdown file in Mesh is automatically indexed and becomes part of your knowledge graph. When you write `[Other Note](/other-note)`, you create a link. When you write `![Embedded Content](/embedded-content)`, you create a transclusion.

Mesh is the center of your workspace. Everything else either feeds into it (context, resources) or flows out of it (exports, outputs).

### Plugins: Agent Capabilities

The `Plugins/` folder extends what you and AI agents can do. Plugins are markdown-based prompt packages - they provide context, skills, templates, and workflows that agents can follow.

For example, the Increments plugin helps you track versioned work. The Living Documents plugin manages document lifecycle. The Projects plugin provides task tracking patterns.

Plugins are safe and inspectable. They don't run arbitrary code - they provide structured prompts that agents interpret.

### Mods: Environment Integration

Mods configure how Flint integrates with your environment. The **git mod** initializes a git repository and manages `.gitignore`. The **claude-code mod** generates `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code integration.

Mods run on install and sync, setting up configuration files that help Flint work seamlessly with your existing tools.

### Workspace: External Resources

The `Workspace/` folder connects your thinking to external reality. When you're documenting an API or planning a feature, Workspace bridges the gap between your notes and the actual codebase.

Declare workspace references in `flint.toml`, fulfill them with local paths, and the reference documents travel with your Flint to explain what each resource is.

## The Folder Structure

```
(Flint) my-project/
├── flint.toml           # Configuration file
├── .flint/              # Runtime data (gitignored)
├── Mesh/                # Your notes and documents
│   └── (System) Flint Init.md
├── Imports/             # Content from other Flints
├── Exports/             # Compiled outputs for sharing
├── Workspace/           # External resource links
├── Media/               # Images, PDFs, assets
└── Plugins/             # Automation capabilities
```

Each folder has a specific purpose:

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `Mesh/` | Your thinking - notes, documents, ideas |
| `Imports/` | External Flint content brought in |
| `Exports/` | Compiled outputs for sharing |
| `Workspace/` | Links to codebases and resources |
| `Media/` | Binary assets (images, PDFs) |
| `Plugins/` | Agent capabilities and automation |

## Obsidian Integration

Flint workspaces work seamlessly with Obsidian. Open any Flint folder as an Obsidian vault, and you get:

- **Graph view** of your note connections
- **Backlinks** panel showing what links to each note
- **Quick switcher** for fast navigation
- **Link completion** as you type `[bash
```

Then create your first workspace:

```bash
flint init my-project
```

This creates the folder structure, initializes configuration, and registers the Flint. From there:

1. **Open the folder** in Obsidian or your preferred editor
2. **Read the init file** at `Mesh/(System) Flint Init.md`
3. **Create notes** in `Mesh/` - they're automatically indexed
4. **Run `flint sync`** to index files and sync plugins

## Key Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `flint init <name>` | Create a new Flint |
| `flint sync` | Sync config, plugins, index |
| `flint list` | List registered Flints |
| `flint index` | Index Mesh files |
| `flint plugin list` | Show installed plugins |
| `flint plugin install X` | Install a plugin |
| `flint repair` | Fix common issues |

## What Makes Flint Different

**Bounded, not infinite.** A Flint has clear edges. One folder, one domain of thought. When it gets too big, split it. This makes workspaces comprehensible to both humans and agents.

**Modules with purposes.** Each folder has a specific role. You know where things go. No more wondering if this document belongs in docs/, notes/, or resources/.

**Declarative configuration.** Everything is declared in TOML and markdown. You describe what you want, not how to achieve it. Configuration is readable and portable.

**Agent-native design.** The init file convention, plugin system, and structured context are designed for AI collaboration from the ground up.

**Just files.** No database, no proprietary format. Your Flint is a folder of markdown files that you can read, edit, and move with any tool.
