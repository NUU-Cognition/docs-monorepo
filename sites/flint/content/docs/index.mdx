**Flint is a bounded cognitive workspace for humans and AI agents to think together.**

## The Problem

Knowledge work is messy. You have notes scattered across apps, code in repositories, references in bookmarks, and ideas in your head. Traditional tools optimize for either storage (folders, databases) or retrieval (search, tags) but miss the bigger picture: how ideas connect and evolve.

When AI agents enter the picture, the problem compounds. An agent can help you write, research, and analyze - but it needs context. Dumping your entire file system into a chat doesn't work. Neither does explaining your project from scratch every session.

## The Solution

Flint creates a *bounded cognitive workspace* - a self-contained environment where your thinking lives as interconnected markdown files. It's not just storage; it's a structured space designed for both human and AI understanding.

The key insight: by organizing knowledge into modules with clear purposes (your notes, your external resources, your outputs, your automation), both you and AI agents can navigate efficiently. An agent entering your Flint can read the init file, understand the structure, and get to work.

## Who Flint is For

**Knowledge workers** managing complex projects - researchers, architects, writers, engineers. If your work involves connecting ideas across domains, Flint gives structure to that process.

**AI-assisted workflows** where you collaborate with agents. Flint provides the shared context that makes agent collaboration effective. Your agent understands where things are and how they connect.

**Teams** who need portable knowledge containers. A Flint can be shared, imported, or connected to other Flints. Your architecture team's Flint can feed into your implementation team's Flint.

## Key Differentiators

**Bounded, not infinite.** A Flint has clear edges. Unlike a file system or wiki, it contains one domain of thought. This makes it comprehensible to both humans and agents.

**Modules with purposes.** Each folder (Mesh, Workspace, Imports, Exports, Plugins, Connections, Media, Subflints) has a specific role. You know where things go.

**Agent-native.** Flint is designed for AI collaboration. Init files explain the workspace. Plugins provide skills. Agents can operate autonomously within defined bounds.

**Declarative, not coded.** Configuration is TOML and markdown. You describe what you want, not how to achieve it. This keeps complexity low and portability high.

**Connected.** Flints can import from and message other Flints. Your research Flint informs your writing Flint. Your architecture Flint guides your implementation Flint.

## Architecture Overview

```
(Flint) My Project/
├── flint.toml           # Configuration
├── .flint/              # Runtime state (indexed data)
├── Mesh/                # Your thinking - notes and documents
├── Imports/             # Content from other Flints
├── Exports/             # Compiled outputs for sharing
├── Workspace/           # Links to external resources
├── Media/               # Images, PDFs, assets
├── Plugins/             # Automation and agent capabilities
├── Connections/         # Messaging with other Flints
└── Subflints/           # Nested Flint workspaces
```

Each module is documented in detail in the Module Documentation section.

## Getting Started

The fastest way to understand Flint is to use it:

1. **Clone**: Clone the NUU monorepo and build the CLI
2. **Create**: `flint init my-project`
3. **Explore**: Look at the generated structure
4. **Read**: Check `Mesh/(System) Flint Init.md`
