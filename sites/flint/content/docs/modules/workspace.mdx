**Connect your Flint to external codebases and resources.**

## Purpose

Your Mesh contains *thoughts about* things. The Workspace module connects those thoughts to the actual things - codebases, data directories, external repositories. When you're documenting an API or planning a feature, Workspace bridges the gap between your notes and the code.

Workspace supports two patterns: local scripts that live inside your Flint, and references to external resources that live elsewhere on your machine. Both let you ground your cognitive work in external reality.

The key insight: Workspace entries appear in `flint.toml` with machine-specific paths (gitignored), while reference documents in `Workspace/` describe the resource and travel with your Flint.

## Structure

```
Workspace/
├── Monorepo.md                 # Reference doc for external codebase
├── Data Pipeline.md            # Reference doc for data project
└── scripts/                    # Local scripts that travel with Flint
    ├── analyze.py
    └── generate-report.sh
```

### Two Patterns

**Pattern A: Local Scripts**

Scripts in `Workspace/scripts/` are part of your Flint. They're committed to git and travel with your workspace. Use for automation specific to this Flint.

```
Workspace/scripts/
├── analyze.py          # Python script
└── generate-report.sh  # Shell script
```

Run via standard tooling:
```bash
uv run Workspace/scripts/analyze.py
bun run Workspace/scripts/generate-report.sh
```

**Pattern B: External References**

External codebases are registered in `flint.toml` (machine-specific, gitignored) with a description file in `Workspace/` (committed, portable):

```toml
# flint.toml
[workspace]
monorepo = { path = "/Users/nathan/dev/nuu/main" }
```

```markdown
# Workspace/Monorepo.md (committed)
# Monorepo

**Type:** codebase
**Registered:** 2025-12-16

## Key Paths

- `packages/flint/` - Core Flint library
- `apps/flint-cli/` - CLI application

## Notes

External resource for the main development monorepo.
```

## Commands

### List Workspace References

```bash
flint workspace list
```

Shows all registered external resources with their local paths and validation status (green for valid, red for missing).

### Add a Reference

```bash
flint workspace reference monorepo /path/to/codebase
```

Registers an external resource. Creates entry in `flint.toml` and a reference markdown file in `Workspace/`.

### Remove a Reference

```bash
flint workspace remove monorepo
```

Removes the entry from `flint.toml` (keeps the `.md` reference file).

## Integration

### Referencing from Mesh

Link to workspace items using the `Workspace/` prefix:

```markdown
See implementation in [Workspace/Monorepo#Key Paths](/docs/workspace-monorepo-key-paths).

The codebase follows [Workspace/Monorepo](/docs/workspace-monorepo) conventions.
```

### With Exports

Workspace references in compiled exports resolve to their descriptions, not raw file contents. This keeps exports portable.

### Symlinks for Direct Access

For frequent access to external resources, you can create symlinks manually:

```bash
# Create symlink manually
ln -s /path/to/external Workspace/Links/external
```

This gives fast access but breaks if the source moves.

## Sync Behavior

When you run `flint sync`, workspace references are validated. If a path is missing or invalid, you'll be prompted to fix it. This ensures your workspace references stay accurate.

## Best Practices

**Document, don't dump.** Workspace references should have description files explaining what the resource is and how it relates to your Flint.

**Keep scripts focused.** `Workspace/scripts/` is for Flint-specific automation. Don't recreate your entire toolchain here.

**Use references for codebases.** External code should be referenced, not copied. Copying creates drift.

**Update paths on new machines.** After cloning a Flint, update `flint.toml` workspace paths for your machine. The reference docs tell you what to register.

**Prefer relative paths in docs.** When describing paths within a workspace resource, use relative paths from that resource's root.

### Common Mistakes

- **Copying code into Workspace** - Reference it; don't copy it
- **Hardcoding paths in Mesh** - Use Workspace references for portability
- **Ignoring reference docs** - They're how others understand your external dependencies
- **Storing secrets in scripts** - Use environment variables, not committed files
