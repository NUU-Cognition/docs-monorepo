**Extend Flint with skills, templates, and automation.**

## Purpose

Flint's core is intentionally minimal - a workspace structure and indexing. Everything else comes from plugins: project management workflows, increment tracking, planning systems, notepad capture.

Plugins are markdown-based prompt packages. They provide context (init files that agents load), skills (repeatable tasks), templates (document structures), and workflows (multi-step processes). Installing a plugin gives your Flint - and the agents working in it - new capabilities.

The plugin system is designed for AI agents. Plugins don't run code; they provide structured prompts that agents interpret. This makes plugins portable, inspectable, and safe.

## Plugin Structure

Each plugin lives in `Plugins/[Name]/` and follows a standard structure:

```
Plugins/
├── Core/                       # Core plugin (base system)
│   ├── plugin.yaml            # Plugin manifest
│   ├── init-core.md           # Context for agents
│   └── meta-core.md           # Plugin metadata
├── Projects/                   # Task management
│   ├── plugin.yaml
│   ├── init-proj.md
│   ├── setup-proj.md          # One-time setup
│   ├── meta-proj.md
│   ├── skills/
│   │   ├── sk-proj-capture_as_task.md
│   │   └── sk-proj-archive_tasks.md
│   ├── templates/
│   │   └── tmp-proj-task.md
│   └── workflows/
│       ├── wkfl-proj-create_task.md
│       └── wkfl-proj-do_task.md
└── Increments/                 # Version tracking
    ├── plugin.yaml
    ├── init-inc.md
    ├── meta-inc.md
    ├── skills/
    │   ├── sk-inc-complete.md
    │   ├── sk-inc-consolidate.md
    │   ├── sk-inc-iterate.md
    │   └── sk-inc-sync.md
    └── templates/
        └── tmp-inc-stream.md
```

### File Types

| Pattern | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `plugin.yaml` | Plugin manifest with version and dependencies | Required |
| `init-[id].md` | Context loaded into agent sessions | `init-proj.md` |
| `setup-[id].md` | One-time initialization instructions | `setup-proj.md` |
| `meta-[id].md` | Plugin metadata for interop | `meta-proj.md` |
| `sk-[id]-[name].md` | Repeatable skill | `sk-proj-archive_tasks.md` |
| `tmp-[id]-[name].md` | Document template | `tmp-proj-task.md` |
| `wkfl-[id]-[name].md` | Multi-step workflow | `wkfl-proj-create_task.md` |

### Plugin Manifest (plugin.yaml)

Every plugin has a `plugin.yaml` that defines its identity and requirements:

```yaml
version: "1.0.0"
name: Projects
shorthand: proj
description: High-level planning and task management
type: prompt
depends:
  - core
  - ld

install:
  - source: (Dashboard) Backlog.md
    dest: Mesh/(Dashboard) Backlog.md

folders:
  - Mesh/Tasks/
  - Mesh/Archive/Tasks/
```

Key fields:
- **version**: Semantic version
- **shorthand**: Short identifier used in CLI commands
- **depends**: Other plugins that must be installed first
- **install**: Files to copy into the mesh on install
- **folders**: Directories to create on install

## Installing Plugins

```bash
flint plugin install <shorthand>
```

This copies the plugin from the registry to `Plugins/` and:
1. Creates the plugin folder with all files
2. Auto-installs any dependencies
3. Creates declared folders in `Mesh/`
4. Installs dashboard files and other declared files

Example:
```bash
flint plugin install proj
```

Output:
```
Installed Projects
  → /path/to/flint/Plugins/Projects
```

### Force Install

Use `--force` to overwrite existing files:

```bash
flint plugin install proj --force
```

## Listing Plugins

### Installed Plugins

```bash
flint plugin list
```

Shows plugins installed in this flint with their versions:

```
Installed plugins:

  NAME              VERSION
  Core              1.0.0
  Living Documents  1.0.0
  Projects          1.0.0
  Increments        1.0.0
```

### Available Plugins

```bash
flint plugin list --available
```

Shows all plugins that can be installed:

```
Available plugins:

  core - Core
    Base plugin system and terminal agent conventions for all Flint agents.
  ld - Living Documents
    Track document lifecycle with living/dead tags
  proj - Projects
    High-level planning and task management
  inc - Increments
    Track work using increment.stream.iteration versioning
  plan - Plan
    High-level planning that maps directly to human intention
  ntpd - Notepad
    Document-based brainstorming with individual notepad files

Install with: flint plugin install <shorthand>
```

## Updating Plugins

```bash
flint plugin update
```

Updates all installed plugins to their latest versions from the registry. This reinstalls each plugin while preserving document IDs in files that have already been customized.

```
Updating 4 plugin(s)...

  ✓ Core
  ✓ Living Documents
  ✓ Projects
  ✓ Increments

Updated 4 plugin(s)
```

## Uninstalling Plugins

```bash
flint plugin uninstall <shorthand>
```

Removes the plugin folder and cleans up:
- Files installed by the plugin (if unchanged)
- Empty folders created by the plugin
- Plugin state tracking

Example:
```bash
flint plugin uninstall proj
```

Note: Files that have been modified since installation are preserved.

## Available Plugins

### Core (core)

Base plugin system. Provides terminal agent conventions, navigation patterns, and file operation guidelines. Foundation for all other plugins.

### Living Documents (ld)

Track document lifecycle with `#ld/living` and `#ld/dead` tags. Documents marked as living are active specifications that should be kept current. Dead documents are archived reference material.

### Projects (proj)

Task management with status tracking. Creates `(Task)` documents in `Mesh/Tasks/` with frontmatter for status (`draft`, `todo`, `in-progress`, `review`, `done`), priority, and completion tracking.

**Skills:**
- `sk-proj-capture_as_task` - Convert notes or ideas into tasks
- `sk-proj-archive_tasks` - Move completed tasks to archive

### Increments (inc)

Version-based work tracking using `X.Y.Z` notation:
- **X** (Checkpoint): Major milestones
- **Y** (Stream): Feature work or themes
- **Z** (Iteration): Individual work sessions

Creates `(Increment)` documents in `Mesh/Increments/`.

**Skills:**
- `sk-inc-complete` - Mark increment as complete
- `sk-inc-consolidate` - Consolidate learnings
- `sk-inc-iterate` - Create new iteration
- `sk-inc-sync` - Sync increment status

### Plan (plan)

High-level planning that maps to human intention. Creates `(Plan)` documents in `Mesh/Plans/` with status progression: `draft` -> `approved` -> `spent`.

**Skills:**
- `sk-plan-refine` - Refine plan details

### Notepad (ntpd)

Document-based brainstorming. Creates dated notepad files in `Mesh/Notepads/` for quick capture before ideas become formal documents.

### Meta-Tasks (mtsk)

Higher-order goals achieved through completion of referenced artifacts. Creates `(Meta-Task)` documents that track completion across multiple related tasks.

### Code Docs (cdocs)

Exhaustive codebase documentation with coverage tracking. Creates documentation in `Mesh/Code Docs/` for tracking what parts of a codebase have been documented.

### Reports (rpt)

Create and organize reports - research findings, code reviews, concept explainers. Creates `(Report)` documents in `Mesh/Reports/`.

### Compile (cmpr)

Create curated collections of notes for compilation. Uses `#compile` tags to mark documents for inclusion in compiled outputs.

### Plugin Template (tmpl)

Meta-plugin for creating new Flint plugins. Provides templates and workflows for plugin authoring.

## Using Plugins

### Loading Context

Agents load plugin context by reading the init file:

```markdown
@Plugins/Projects/init-proj.md
```

The init file explains the plugin's concepts, conventions, and available capabilities.

### Using Skills

Skills are invoked by reading the skill file:

```markdown
Use the archive skill: @Plugins/Projects/skills/sk-proj-archive_tasks.md
```

Skills contain step-by-step instructions the agent follows.

### Using Templates

Templates define document structures:

```markdown
Create a task using: @Plugins/Projects/templates/tmp-proj-task.md
```

Templates include placeholders and generation instructions.

### Using Workflows

Workflows are multi-step processes with human checkpoints:

```markdown
Follow: @Plugins/Projects/workflows/wkfl-proj-create_task.md
```

# Mods

Mods are environment modifications that configure external tools to work with Flint. Unlike plugins (which are prompt-based), mods create files and run hooks that integrate with the broader development environment.

## Plugins vs Mods

| Aspect | Plugins | Mods |
|--------|---------|------|
| Purpose | Extend agent capabilities | Configure environment |
| Files | Markdown prompts | Config files, scripts |
| Location | `Plugins/` folder | Various (CLAUDE.md, .gitignore, etc.) |
| Execution | Interpreted by agents | Run by Flint or external tools |
| Examples | Projects, Increments, Plan | Claude Code, Git |

## Installing Mods

```bash
flint mod install <shorthand>
```

Example:
```bash
flint mod install cc
```

Output:
```
Installed mod Claude Code
  Created files:
    → CLAUDE.md
    → .claude/settings.json
```

### Force Install

Use `--force` to overwrite existing files:

```bash
flint mod install cc --force
```

## Listing Mods

### Installed Mods

```bash
flint mod list
```

Shows mods installed in this flint:

```
Installed mods:

  ● claude-code v1.0.0
```

### Available Mods

```bash
flint mod list --available
```

Shows all mods that can be installed:

```
Available mods:

  cc - Claude Code
    Configure Claude Code for this flint
  git - Git
    Git version control integration for Flint meshes

Install with: flint mod install <shorthand>
```

## Updating Mods

```bash
flint mod update
```

Updates all installed mods, regenerating their configuration files.

## Uninstalling Mods

```bash
flint mod uninstall <shorthand>
```

Removes files created by the mod and cleans up state.

## Available Mods

### Claude Code (cc)

Configures Claude Code to work with this Flint. Creates:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Instructions for Claude Code agents
- `.claude/settings.json` - Claude Code settings

This mod sets up the workspace so Claude Code understands Flint conventions and can navigate the mesh effectively.

### Git (git)

Git version control integration. Uses hooks to:
- Initialize git repository on install
- Sync git state during `flint sync`

## Mod Hooks

Mods can define hooks that run at specific points in the Flint lifecycle:

| Hook | When |
|------|------|
| `onInstall` | After mod is installed |
| `onUninstall` | Before mod is removed |
| `onInit` | During `flint init` |
| `onSync` | During `flint sync` |

Hooks are TypeScript functions that receive the flint path and can perform any necessary setup or cleanup.

## Best Practices

**Load plugins on demand.** Don't load every init file at session start. Load when you need that plugin's capabilities.

**Read init before using.** The init file explains conventions. Don't guess - read the instructions.

**Run setup once.** Setup files are one-time initialization. Don't re-run unless troubleshooting.

**Respect plugin boundaries.** Each plugin manages its domain. Don't manually edit plugin-managed dashboards.

**Check dependencies.** Some plugins depend on others. The CLI handles this automatically, but understand the relationships.

### Common Mistakes

- **Loading all plugins** - Context overload. Load what you need.
- **Skipping setup** - Some plugins need setup to initialize the mesh
- **Editing managed files** - Dashboards may be overwritten on update
- **Ignoring conventions** - Each plugin has naming and tagging conventions. Follow them.
