title: "Mesh"
---

The Mesh is your thinking space - a folder of interconnected markdown files where ideas, tasks, and knowledge live.

## Purpose

Every Flint has a `Mesh/` folder at its heart. This is where you write notes, track projects, and develop ideas. Unlike flat file storage, the Mesh treats your notes as a connected knowledge graph. Link notes with `[wiki-style](/wiki-style)` references, and those connections become navigable.

The Mesh module provides:
- **Indexing** - Every note gets a unique ID for reliable linking
- **Organization** - Typed prefixes organize documents by purpose
- **Linking** - Wiki-style links create a knowledge graph
- **Archiving** - Move completed work to archive with proper tagging

## Structure

Notes live in the `Mesh/` folder. You can organize them flat or in subfolders:

```
Mesh/
├── (System) Flint Init.md       # Entry point for agents
├── (Dashboard) Backlog.md       # Project overview
├── (Task) Current Work.md       # Active work item
├── Architecture Notes.md        # Regular note
├── Plans/                       # Subfolder for plans
│   └── (Plan) Q1 Roadmap.md
└── Archive/                     # Completed/historical items
    └── Tasks/
        └── (Task) Old Work.md
```

## Typed Documents

Flint uses a `(Type) Name.md` naming convention to categorize notes. The type prefix helps both humans and tools understand what a note represents.

### Common Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `(System)` | Configuration and navigation | `(System) Flint Init.md` |
| `(Dashboard)` | Overview and tracking views | `(Dashboard) Backlog.md` |
| `(Task)` | Actionable work items | `(Task) Fix Login Bug.md` |
| `(Plan)` | High-level plans and proposals | `(Plan) Q1 Roadmap.md` |
| `(Increment)` | Versioned work streams | `(Increment) 1.2.0 - Feature X.md` |
| `(Doc)` | Documentation | `(Doc) API Reference.md` |
| `(Notepad)` | Temporary working notes | `(Notepad) 2025-01-15 Meeting.md` |

Notes without a type prefix are regular concept notes.

### Type Extraction

When archiving, the type is extracted from the filename and routes the note to the appropriate archive subfolder if it exists:

```
(Task) Old Work.md → Archive/Tasks/(Task) Old Work.md
(Plan) Old Plan.md → Archive/Plans/(Plan) Old Plan.md
```

## Frontmatter

Every note can have YAML frontmatter for metadata. The indexer ensures each note has a unique `id`.

### Basic Structure

```yaml
---
id: a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
tags:
  - "#project/alpha"
  - "#status/active"
status: in-progress
priority: high
---

# Note Title

Content here...
```

### Common Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | UUID, auto-generated by indexer |
| `tags` | array | List of tags (with `#` prefix) |
| `status` | string | Task/plan status |
| `priority` | string | Priority level |
| `created` | string | Creation date |
| `completed` | string | Completion date |

The `id` field is required for reliable linking and is automatically added by `flint index`.

### Tags

Tags can appear in frontmatter or inline in content:

```yaml
tags:
  - "#project/alpha"
  - "#ld/living"
```

Or inline: `This note is about #project/alpha.`

Frontmatter tags are indexed. Use hierarchical tags like `#project/alpha` or `#status/done` for organization.

## Living Documents

The Living Documents system uses tags to track note lifecycle:

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `#ld/living` | Active, maintained document |
| `#ld/dead` | Archived, historical document |

When archiving a note, the system:
1. Adds `#archived` tag
2. Replaces `#ld/living` with `#ld/dead`
3. Moves the file to `Mesh/Archive/`

## Indexing

The indexer scans your Mesh and ensures every note has a unique ID.

### Running the Indexer

```bash
# Index all files
flint index

# Preview changes without modifying files
flint index --dry-run

# See each file processed
flint index --verbose
```

### What Indexing Does

1. Scans all `.md` files in `Mesh/` (skips symlinks)
2. Adds `id` field to frontmatter if missing
3. Extracts tags from frontmatter
4. Writes index to `.flint/index/files.json`

### Index Structure

The index at `.flint/index/files.json`:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "indexed": "2025-01-15T10:00:00.000Z",
  "files": [
    {
      "id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
      "path": "Mesh/Architecture Notes.md",
      "tags": ["#project/alpha", "#ld/living"],
      "modified": "2025-01-15T09:30:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Excluded Directories

The scanner automatically skips:
- `.obsidian/` - Obsidian configuration
- `.git/` - Git repository data
- `node_modules/` - Package dependencies
- Hidden directories (starting with `.`)
- Symlinks (Workspace/, Imports/ often contain symlinks)

## Wiki-Links

Notes connect through wiki-style links:

### Basic Links

```markdown
See [Related Concept](/related-concept) for more details.
```

### Aliased Links

```markdown
See [this concept](/related-concept) for more details.
```

### Transclusion (Embedding)

```markdown
![Embedded Note](/embedded-note)
```

Transclusion embeds the content of another note inline. This is used by the export system to compile documents.

### Section Links

```markdown
See [Related Concept#Specific Section](/related-concept-specific-section).
```

## Plugin Interaction

Plugins read from and write to the Mesh:

### Projects Plugin

Creates and manages task notes:

```
Mesh/Tasks/(Task) Fix Bug.md
```

With frontmatter:

```yaml
status: todo
priority: high
```

### Increments Plugin

Creates versioned work stream notes:

```
Mesh/Increments/(Increment) 1.2.0 - Feature X.md
```

### Notepad Plugin

Creates temporary working notes:

```
Mesh/(Notepad) 2025-01-15 Session.md
```

### Plan Plugin

Creates and tracks plans:

```
Mesh/Plans/(Plan) Q1 Roadmap.md
```

Plugins use the `Mesh/` folder as their workspace, following the typed document conventions.

## Best Practices

### Organization

**Start with an entry point.** Create `(System) Flint Init.md` as your main index. Link to key areas.

**Use consistent naming.** Pick a convention and stick with it. Type prefixes help categorization.

**Link liberally.** The power of Mesh comes from connections. When you mention a concept, link it: `[that concept](/that-concept)`.

**Archive, don't delete.** Move completed notes to `Archive/` rather than deleting. History is valuable.

**Keep notes atomic.** One concept per note. Link related concepts rather than cramming everything together.

### Tags

**Use hierarchical tags.** `#project/alpha`, `#status/done`, `#type/task` - structure helps organization.

**Mark living documents.** Use `#ld/living` for active notes, let archiving handle `#ld/dead`.

**Be consistent.** Decide on tag naming conventions early. `#status/active` or `#active`? Pick one.

### Avoid

- **Giant monolithic notes** - Split them up and link the pieces
- **Forgetting to index** - Run `flint index` after adding files externally
- **Duplicate concepts** - Search before creating; link instead of copying
- **Deep nesting** - Keep folder structure shallow; use links for relationships
