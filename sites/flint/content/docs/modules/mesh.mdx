**The core thinking space where your ideas live as interconnected notes.**

## Purpose

The Mesh is Flint's foundation - a directory of markdown files that represent your externalized thoughts, concepts, and working documents. Unlike traditional file storage, Mesh treats your notes as a connected knowledge graph where ideas link to each other through wiki-style references.

The Mesh module handles indexing, querying, and graph navigation. When you create a note, it's automatically indexed. When you link notes with `[brackets](/docs/brackets)`, those connections become navigable. The result is a personal knowledge base that grows with your thinking.

Every other Flint module either draws from Mesh (Exports compiles it, Connections shares it) or feeds into it (Imports brings external context, Workspace provides reality to model). Mesh is the center of your cognitive workspace.

## Structure

```
Mesh/
├── (System) Flint Init.md     # Entry point for agents
├── (System) Index.md          # Your main dashboard
├── (Dashboard) Projects.md    # Project tracking
├── (Task) Current Work.md     # Active tasks
├── Concept A.md               # A concept note
├── Concept B.md               # Another concept
└── Archive/                   # Completed/historical items
    └── Old Project.md
```

### Naming Conventions

Flint uses prefixes to categorize notes:

- `(System)` - Configuration and navigation files
- `(Dashboard)` - Overview and tracking documents
- `(Task)` - Actionable work items
- `(Increment)` - Versioned work streams
- `(Compile)` - Export compilation instructions
- No prefix - Regular concept notes

### File Format

Every markdown file can have YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
id: uuid-auto-generated
tags:
  - "#concept"
  - "#draft"
---

# My Concept

This relates to [Other Concept](/docs/other-concept).

Key insight from another note:
![Source Note](/docs/source-note)
```

The `id` is auto-generated by `flint sync` or `mesh index`. Tags can be in frontmatter or inline as `#tag`.

## Commands

### Index the Mesh

```bash
mesh index
```

Scans all markdown files and ensures each has a unique ID in frontmatter. Updates the index at `.flint/index/files.json`.

```bash
flint sync
```

Also indexes files as part of the sync process.

### Query Notes by Tag

```bash
mesh query --tag "#task"
mesh query --tag "#ld/living" --format json
mesh query -t "#draft"
```

Query only supports filtering by tag. Use the exact tag string including the `#` prefix.

### Rename Notes

```bash
mesh rename "Old Name" "New Name"
mesh rename "Mesh/Old Name.md" "Mesh/New Name.md"
```

Renames the file and updates all wiki-links that reference it across the entire Mesh.

### Compile Notes

```bash
mesh compile "Note Name"
mesh compile "User Guide" --depth 3
```

Compiles a note by resolving all `![embeds](/docs/embeds)` transclusions.

## Integration

### With Exports

Mesh notes are the source material for compiled exports. Create manifest files in `Exports/` that list wiki-links to include, then build with `flint export build`.

### With Imports

Imported bundles from other Flints appear in `Imports/` and can be referenced from Mesh notes:

```markdown
[Imports/(Import) Architecture/API Patterns](/docs/imports-import-architecture-api-patterns)
```

### With Media

Binary assets live in `Media/` and are embedded in Mesh notes:

```markdown
![Media/diagram.png](/docs/media-diagram-png)
![Media/reference.pdf](/docs/media-reference-pdf)
```

### With Plugins

Plugins read and write to Mesh. Agent plugins use Mesh as their workspace. The Living Documents plugin manages note lifecycle through frontmatter tags.

## Index Structure

The index at `.flint/index/files.json` tracks all indexed files:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "indexed": "2025-12-18T10:00:00.000Z",
  "files": [
    {
      "id": "uuid-here",
      "path": "Mesh/Concept A.md",
      "tags": ["#concept"],
      "modified": "2025-12-18T09:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

**Start with an Index.** Create `(System) Index.md` as your entry point. Link to your main areas of focus.

**Use consistent naming.** Pick a convention (prefixes, folders, or both) and stick with it. Future-you will thank present-you.

**Link liberally.** The power of Mesh comes from connections. When you mention a concept, link it: `[that concept](/docs/that-concept)`.

**Archive, don't delete.** Move completed or obsolete notes to `Archive/` rather than deleting. You might need them later.

**Keep notes atomic.** One concept per note. Link related concepts rather than cramming everything into one file.

### Common Mistakes

- **Giant monolithic notes** - Split them up and link the pieces
- **Forgetting to index** - Run `mesh index` or `flint sync` after adding files externally
- **Broken links** - Check your links manually; search for referenced note names
- **Duplicate concepts** - Search before creating; link instead of copying
