**Extend Flint with skills, templates, and automation.**

## Purpose

Flint's core is intentionally minimal - a workspace structure and indexing. Everything else comes from plugins: project management workflows, living document verification, archive operations, agent skills.

Plugins are markdown-based prompt packages. They provide context (init files that agents load), skills (repeatable tasks), templates (document structures), and workflows (multi-step processes). Installing a plugin gives your Flint - and the agents working in it - new capabilities.

The plugin system is designed for AI agents. Plugins don't run code by default; they provide structured prompts that agents interpret. This makes plugins portable, inspectable, and safe.

## Structure

```
Plugins/
├── Core/                       # Core plugin (always present)
│   ├── init-core.md           # Context for agents
│   └── meta-core.md           # Plugin metadata
├── Living Documents/           # Living docs plugin
│   ├── init-ld.md
│   ├── setup-ld.md            # One-time setup skill
│   └── skills/
│       └── sk-ld-verify.md
├── Increments/                 # Work stream plugin
│   ├── init-inc.md
│   ├── templates/
│   │   └── tmp-inc-stream.md
│   └── workflows/
│       └── wkfl-inc-plan.md
└── Archive/                    # Archival plugin
    ├── init-arc.md
    └── skills/
        └── sk-arc-archive.md
```

### File Naming Conventions

| Pattern | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `init-[id].md` | Context loaded into agent sessions | `init-ld.md` |
| `setup-[id].md` | One-time initialization skill | `setup-inc.md` |
| `sk-[id]-[name].md` | Repeatable skill | `sk-arc-archive.md` |
| `tmp-[id]-[name].md` | Document template | `tmp-inc-stream.md` |
| `wkfl-[id]-[name].md` | Multi-step workflow | `wkfl-proj-plan.md` |
| `meta-[id].md` | Plugin metadata | `meta-core.md` |

### Plugin Shorthand

Each plugin has a short identifier:

- `core` - Core plugin
- `ld` - Living Documents
- `inc` - Increments
- `arc` - Archive
- `proj` - Projects
- `ntpd` - Notepad
- `cm` - Comments
- `fta` - Flint Terminal Agent
- `auto` - Autonomy
- `tst` - Testing
- `cmpr` - Compiler
- `conn` - Connections
- `mdl` - Models
- `doc` - Documentation
- `tl` - Timelines

## Commands

### List Installed Plugins

```bash
flint plugin list
```

Shows installed plugins and their status.

### List Available Plugins

```bash
flint plugin list --available
```

Shows plugins that can be installed.

### Install a Plugin

```bash
flint plugin install inc
```

Copies the plugin from the registry to `Plugins/`.

### Update All Plugins

```bash
flint plugin update
```

Updates all installed plugins to their latest versions.

### Uninstall a Plugin

```bash
flint plugin uninstall inc
```

Removes the plugin directory.

## Using Plugins

### Loading Context

Agents load plugin context by reading init files:

```markdown
@Plugins/Increments/init-inc.md
```

The init file explains the plugin's concepts, conventions, and available skills.

### Using Skills

Skills are prompted by reading the skill file:

```markdown
Use the archive skill: @Plugins/Archive/skills/sk-arc-archive.md
```

The skill file contains instructions the agent follows.

### Using Templates

Templates define document structures:

```markdown
Create a new increment using: @Plugins/Increments/templates/tmp-inc-stream.md
```

Templates contain placeholders and generation instructions.

### Using Workflows

Workflows are multi-step processes:

```markdown
Follow the planning workflow: @Plugins/Increments/workflows/wkfl-inc-plan.md
```

Workflows involve human-in-the-loop checkpoints.

## Integration

### With Mesh

Plugins create and manage Mesh documents. The Increments plugin creates `(Increment)` files. The Archive plugin moves files to `Mesh/Archive/`.

### Plugin Status

Plugin status is tracked in `Mesh/(System) Plugin Status.md`:

```markdown
## Plugin Status

- Core 1.0.0: installed
- Living Documents 1.0.0: initialized
- Increments 1.0.0: initialized
```

### With Agents

Plugins are designed for AI agents. The Flint Terminal Agent plugin (`fta`) provides conventions for how agents should operate in the workspace.

## Built-in Plugins

**Core** - Base system, always installed. File operations, navigation, conventions.

**Living Documents** - Self-verifying specifications. Track document status, run verification.

**Increments** - Work stream management. Version-numbered work packages with tasks.

**Archive** - Move completed items to archive. Maintain history.

**Projects** - Project tracking. Group related work, track status.

**Notepad** - Quick capture. Scratchpad for ideas before they become notes.

**Comments** - Add timestamped comments to notes. Discussion threads.

**Flint Terminal Agent** - Agent operating conventions. How agents work in Flint.

**Autonomy** - Autonomous workflows and agent sessions.

**Testing** - Test tracking and verification.

**Compiler** - Export compilation helpers.

**Connections** - Connection management helpers.

**Models** - Model and schema tracking.

**Documentation** - Documentation generation.

**Timelines** - Timeline visualization.

## Best Practices

**Load plugins on demand.** Don't load every init file at session start. Load when you need that plugin's capabilities.

**Read init before using.** The init file explains conventions. Don't guess - read the instructions.

**Run setup once.** Setup skills are one-time. Don't re-run unless troubleshooting.

**Respect plugin boundaries.** Each plugin manages its domain. Don't manually edit plugin-managed files.

**Check status after install.** Some plugins need initialization after installation.

### Common Mistakes

- **Loading all plugins** - Context overload. Load what you need.
- **Skipping setup** - Plugins may not work until setup runs
- **Editing managed files** - Let plugins manage their documents
- **Ignoring conventions** - Each plugin has naming and tagging conventions. Follow them.
