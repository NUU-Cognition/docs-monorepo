title: "Imports"
---

**Bring cognitive context from other Flints into your workspace.**

## Purpose

The Imports module lets you pull content from other Flint workspaces into your own. When you're working on a project that relates to another domain (maybe your architecture notes live in a separate Flint from your implementation notes), Imports bridges that gap.

Unlike Connections (which is for messaging between Flints), Imports is for bringing in *content* - actual notes you want to reference, quote, or build upon. Think of it as importing a library: you get read access to another Mesh's exports.

Imports are one-way. The source Flint publishes to its Exports folder; you import that export into your Imports folder. Updates flow downstream - you pull, they push.

## Structure

```
Imports/
├── (Import) Architecture/      # Imported from Architecture Flint
│   └── api-bundle/             # The specific export
│       ├── (Import) (Architecture) API Patterns.md
│       └── (Import) (Architecture) System Design.md
└── (Import) Research/          # Another import
    └── Main/
        └── (Import) (Research) Literature Review.md
```

### File Naming

Imported files are prefixed with `(Import) (SourceName)` to clearly indicate their origin and prevent conflicts with local Mesh files.

### Import Tracking

Import state is tracked in `.flint/flint.lock`:

```yaml
imports:
  - mesh: "(Mesh) Architecture"
    meshId: "uuid-here"
    export: "api-bundle"
    path: "Imports/(Import) Architecture/api-bundle"
    lastSync: "2025-12-18T10:00:00.000Z"
```

## Commands

### List Available Imports

```bash
flint import list
flint import list "Architecture"  # From specific Flint
```

Shows available exports from connected Flints and current imports.

### Import from Another Flint

```bash
flint import add "Architecture/api-bundle"
```

Copies the named export from the other Flint into `Imports/`.

### Update an Import

```bash
flint import sync
flint import sync "Architecture/api-bundle"
```

Re-syncs from the source, pulling any changes.

## Integration

### Referencing Imports from Mesh

Once imported, reference notes using the full path:

```markdown
According to [Imports/(Import) Architecture/api-bundle/(Import) (Architecture) API Patterns](/docs/imports-import-architecture-api-bundle-import-architecture-api-patterns), we should...
```

Or use the simpler display alias:

```markdown
[API Patterns](/docs/imports-import-architecture-api-bundle-import-architecture-api-patterns)
```

### With Exports

You can re-export imported content (with attribution). Useful for creating derivative works or curated collections.

### Difference from Connections

| Imports | Connections |
|---------|-------------|
| Pull content from exports | Send/receive messages |
| One-way (source → you) | Two-way communication |
| Bundles of notes | Individual messages |
| Read-only | Read-write |

Use Imports when you need reference material. Use Connections when you need ongoing dialogue.

## Best Practices

**Import exports, not raw Meshes.** The source Flint should prepare an export bundle. Don't import their entire Mesh - that's coupling too tightly.

**Use copy for stability.** Imports are copied, not linked. This gives you a stable snapshot that doesn't break if the source moves.

**Document your imports.** Note in your Mesh why you imported something and how it relates to your work.

**Keep imports focused.** Import specific bundles you need, not everything. Your Imports folder shouldn't dwarf your Mesh.

**Update deliberately.** Review changes before pulling - the source may have reorganized.

### Common Mistakes

- **Importing full Meshes** - Import curated exports instead
- **Circular imports** - Don't import from a Flint that imports from you
- **Stale imports** - Check `flint import list` periodically
- **Editing imported files** - They'll be overwritten on next sync; copy to Mesh first
