**Store and reference images, PDFs, and other binary assets.**

## Purpose

Some knowledge isn't text. Diagrams, screenshots, PDFs, recordings - these binary assets need a home. The Media module provides that home, keeping your non-markdown files organized and accessible from your Mesh notes.

Media is deliberately simple. It's a folder for assets with a referencing convention. Files go in, you link to them from Mesh, and they appear inline or as attachments in your notes.

Unlike Mesh, Media files aren't indexed for content search (they're binary). Unlike Workspace, Media files travel with your Flint (they're committed). Media is for assets that are *part of* your knowledge base, not external resources you're referencing.

## Structure

```
Media/
├── diagrams/
│   ├── architecture.png
│   └── flow-chart.svg
├── screenshots/
│   ├── ui-mockup.png
│   └── error-state.png
├── references/
│   ├── paper.pdf
│   └── specification.pdf
└── recordings/
    └── meeting-2025-12-18.mp3
```

### Organization

Flat or nested - your choice. Common patterns:

- **By type**: `diagrams/`, `screenshots/`, `documents/`
- **By project**: `project-alpha/`, `project-beta/`
- **Flat**: Everything at top level (fine for small Flints)

### Supported Formats

**Images**: PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG, WebP
**Documents**: PDF
**Video**: MP4, WebM, MOV
**Audio**: MP3, WAV, M4A

Other binary formats work but may not render inline.

## Referencing Media

From Mesh notes, embed assets with the transclusion syntax:

```markdown
Here's the architecture diagram:
![Media/diagrams/architecture.png](/docs/media-diagrams-architecture-png)

See the specification:
![Media/references/specification.pdf](/docs/media-references-specification-pdf)

Listen to the discussion:
![Media/recordings/meeting.mp3](/docs/media-recordings-meeting-mp3)
```

### Image Sizing

Some editors support size hints:

```markdown
![500](/docs/media-diagram-png)        # 500px width
![300x200](/docs/media-diagram-png)    # Explicit dimensions
```

### Linking vs Embedding

Embed (`![...](/docs/)`) displays inline. Link (`[...](/docs/)`) creates a reference:

```markdown
![Media/diagram.png](/docs/media-diagram-png)    # Shows the image
[Media/diagram.png](/docs/media-diagram-png)     # Links to the file
```

## Integration

### With Mesh

Media is referenced from Mesh notes. The notes provide context; Media provides visual evidence.

```markdown
# Architecture Overview

The system has three layers:
![Media/diagrams/three-layer.png](/docs/media-diagrams-three-layer-png)

As shown above, Layer A communicates with Layer B via...
```

### With Exports

Media references in notes are preserved when compiling exports. The exported files maintain their references to the Media folder.

### With Index

Media files are skipped during indexing (they're binary and not searchable). Only the `Imports/`, `Workspace/`, and `Media/` prefixes are excluded from wiki-link indexing.

## Best Practices

**Use descriptive names.** `architecture-v2-2025-12.png` beats `image1.png`. You'll thank yourself later.

**Organize by purpose.** Group related assets. A diagram supporting a specific note might live in `Media/project-name/`.

**Compress images.** Large images slow everything down. Use appropriate compression.

**Prefer vector formats.** SVG for diagrams scales infinitely. PNG for screenshots.

**Keep originals.** If you edit an image, keep the original (maybe in `Media/originals/`). You might need to re-edit.

**Don't embed large files.** PDFs and videos should be linked, not embedded. Let the reader choose to open them.

### When to Use Media vs Other Modules

| Use Case | Module |
|----------|--------|
| Diagram you created | Media |
| Screenshot of your UI | Media |
| External spec PDF you need | Media |
| Code you're documenting | Workspace |
| Another Flint's exports | Imports |
| Notes and concepts | Mesh |

### Common Mistakes

- **Storing code in Media** - Code isn't binary; it belongs in Workspace or Mesh
- **Huge uncompressed images** - Compress before adding
- **Orphaned assets** - Periodically check for Media files with no references
- **Wrong format choices** - JPEG for diagrams loses quality; PNG for photos wastes space
