**Compile and share content from your Flint.**

## Purpose

Mesh notes are interconnected - they link freely, embed content from each other, and form a web of knowledge. But when you need to share that knowledge, you often need linear, self-contained documents.

The Exports module compiles your Mesh notes into portable artifacts. It resolves transclusions (expanding embedded content), rewrites wiki-links, strips frontmatter, and produces clean output files that can be shared with others or imported into other Flints.

## Export Structure

Exports live in the `Exports/` folder at the root of your Flint:

```
Exports/
├── Guide.md                      # Export manifest
├── Guide/                        # Built export folder
│   ├── E (NUU Flint) Index.md
│   ├── E (NUU Flint) Getting Started.md
│   ├── E (NUU Flint) Reference.md
│   └── _manifest.json
└── API.md                        # Another export manifest
```

Each export has two components:
1. **Manifest file** - A markdown file that defines what to export
2. **Output folder** - Created when you build the export, named after the manifest

## Export Manifests

An export manifest is a markdown file in `Exports/` that lists the notes to include. The manifest file name becomes the export name.

### Basic Manifest

```markdown
---
description: Complete user guide for Flint
---

# User Guide

This export contains the essential documentation.

[Getting Started](/getting-started)
[Core Concepts](/core-concepts)
[Command Reference](/command-reference)
```

The manifest can include any markdown content - headings, prose, explanations. The key elements are the **wiki-links** that reference notes to include.

### Manifest Frontmatter

Manifests support these frontmatter fields:

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `description` | Brief description of the export | none |
| `depth` | How many link levels to follow. `1` = direct links only, `2` = links and their links, `-1` = unlimited | `1` |

### Depth Control

The `depth` field controls how deeply the exporter follows links:

```markdown
---
description: Just the listed notes
depth: 1
---

[Note A](/note-a)
[Note B](/note-b)
```

With `depth: 1`, only Note A and Note B are exported. If Note A links to Note C, that link is rewritten but Note C is not included.

```markdown
---
description: Listed notes and everything they reference
depth: -1
---

[Note A](/note-a)
```

With `depth: -1`, the exporter follows all links recursively, including every referenced note.

## The `flint export` Command

### List Exports

```bash
flint export list
```

Shows all export manifests and their build status:

```
Exports

  ● Guide (12 files)
  ○ API (not built)

Use 'flint export build <name>' to build an export.
```

### Build an Export

Build a specific export:

```bash
flint export build Guide
```

Build all exports:

```bash
flint export build
flint export build --all
```

Building an export:
1. Reads the manifest file
2. Collects all referenced notes (respecting depth)
3. Expands embeds inline
4. Rewrites wiki-links with export prefixes
5. Strips frontmatter from all files
6. Writes output to the export folder
7. Generates `_manifest.json`

The build command also automatically removes stale export folders (those without a corresponding manifest file).

### Check Export Status

```bash
flint export status
```

Shows build status for each export:

```
Export Status

  ✓ Guide - 12 files
  ○ API - not built
```

## File Transformations

When notes are exported, several transformations are applied.

### File Naming Convention

Exported files are prefixed with the Flint name:

```
E (Flint Name) Original Name.md
```

For example, a note called `Getting Started.md` from a Flint named `NUU Flint` becomes:

```
E (NUU Flint) Getting Started.md
```

The `E` prefix indicates an exported file. This naming ensures exported files are distinguishable when imported into other Flints.

### Duplicate Name Handling

If multiple notes share the same base name (e.g., `Tasks/README.md` and `Docs/README.md`), the exporter disambiguates them by including the path:

```
E (NUU Flint) README (Mesh - Tasks).md
E (NUU Flint) README (Mesh - Docs).md
```

### Wiki-Link Rewriting

Links are rewritten to reference the prefixed file names:

**Source:**
```markdown
See [Getting Started](/getting-started) for details.
```

**Exported:**
```markdown
See [Getting Started](/e-nuu-flint-getting-started) for details.
```

The original name is preserved as a display alias for readability.

### Transclusion Expansion

Embeds (`![...](/)`) are expanded into blockquotes with the content inlined:

**Source:**
```markdown
Here's an important concept:

![Key Insight](/key-insight)
```

**Exported:**
```markdown
Here's an important concept:

> **Key Insight**
>
> The actual content from the Key Insight note goes here,
> formatted as a blockquote.
```

Circular embeds (where Note A embeds Note B which embeds Note A) are detected and replaced with a comment to prevent infinite loops.

### Frontmatter Stripping

All frontmatter is removed from exported files. This produces cleaner output for sharing and ensures internal metadata (like UUIDs and tags) does not leak into exports.

## The _manifest.json File

Each built export includes a `_manifest.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "Guide",
  "flint": "NUU Flint",
  "builtAt": "2025-01-16T10:30:00.000Z",
  "files": [
    "E (NUU Flint) Index.md",
    "E (NUU Flint) Getting Started.md",
    "E (NUU Flint) Core Concepts.md"
  ]
}
```

This manifest records:
- **name** - The export name (from the manifest file)
- **flint** - The source Flint name
- **builtAt** - ISO timestamp of the build
- **files** - List of all files in the export

The `_manifest.json` is used by the Imports module to understand what files belong to an export.

## Use Cases

### Sharing Documentation

Create a `Docs.md` manifest that lists your user-facing documentation:

```markdown
---
description: Public documentation for users
depth: 2
---

# Documentation Export

[Quick Start](/quick-start)
[User Guide](/user-guide)
[FAQ](/faq)
[Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting)
```

Build it and share the `Docs/` folder with your team.

### Publishing to a Website

Export your content, then process the markdown files with a static site generator. The clean, frontmatter-free output works well with tools like Astro, Next.js, or Hugo.

### Sharing Context with Other Flints

Create focused exports that other Flints can import:

```markdown
---
description: Architecture overview for dependent projects
depth: 1
---

# Architecture Export

[System Architecture](/system-architecture)
[API Reference](/api-reference)
[Data Models](/data-models)
```

Other Flints can then import this bundle to have access to your architecture documentation.

### Creating Snapshots

Export a point-in-time snapshot of your project state:

```markdown
---
description: v2.0 release documentation snapshot
---

# v2.0 Release

[Release Notes v2.0](/release-notes-v2-0)
[Migration Guide v2.0](/migration-guide-v2-0)
[API Changes v2.0](/api-changes-v2-0)
```

## Best Practices

**Design exports for your audience.** A guide for humans differs from a bundle for other Flints. Consider who will consume the export.

**Use depth intentionally.** `depth: 1` creates focused exports with only listed notes. `depth: -1` captures everything but can include more than expected.

**Keep manifests updated.** When you add notes to a documentation series, remember to add them to the relevant export manifest.

**Test your exports.** Read the compiled output. Broken links, missing context, and ordering issues only reveal themselves in the final artifact.

**Use descriptive names.** The manifest file name becomes the export folder name. Choose names that communicate purpose: `API-Reference.md`, `User-Guide.md`, `Architecture.md`.
