**Transform your interconnected notes into shareable, linear documents.**

## Purpose

Mesh is great for thinking - notes link freely, ideas branch and reconnect. But when you need to share knowledge, you need linear output: a document with a beginning, middle, and end.

The Exports module compiles your Mesh notes into publishable artifacts. It resolves transclusions (pulling in embedded content), rewrites wiki-links, and produces clean output.

Exports serve two purposes: sharing with humans (guides, specifications, reports) and sharing with other Flints (bundles that can be imported). Either way, Exports is how your thinking becomes portable.

## Structure

```
Exports/
├── guide.md                    # Export manifest
├── guide/                      # Built export folder
│   ├── (MeshName) --- Introduction.md
│   ├── (MeshName) --- Getting Started.md
│   └── (MeshName) --- Reference.md
└── api-bundle.md               # Another export manifest
```

### Export Manifests

Exports are defined by markdown files in `Exports/`. Each manifest lists the notes to include via wiki-links:

```markdown
---
id: uuid
description: Complete user guide
---

# User Guide Export

Include these in order:

[Introduction to Flint](/docs/introduction-to-flint)
[Getting Started](/docs/getting-started)
[Command Reference](/docs/command-reference)
```

The manifest file name becomes the export name.

## Commands

### List Exports

```bash
flint export list
```

Shows all export manifests and their build status.

### Build an Export

```bash
flint export build guide
```

Reads the manifest, processes linked notes, and writes to an output folder.

### Check Export Status

```bash
flint export status
```

Shows build status for all exports.

### Compile a Note Directly

```bash
mesh compile "Note Name"
mesh compile "User Guide" --depth 3
```

For quick compilation without a manifest, use `mesh compile` directly on any note.

## How Compilation Works

1. **Read manifest** - Parse the wiki-links listed in the export manifest
2. **Collect notes** - Gather all referenced notes
3. **Expand embeds** - Resolve `![embed](/docs/embed)` transclusions
4. **Rewrite links** - Update wiki-links with prefixed file names
5. **Write output** - Create files in the export folder

### File Naming in Exports

Built files are prefixed with the source Mesh name:

```
(MeshName) --- Original File Name.md
```

This ensures exported files can be distinguished when imported into other Flints.

### Wiki-Link Rewriting

Links are rewritten to reference the prefixed names:

```markdown
# Source
See [Other Concept](/docs/other-concept) for details.

# Built output
See [Other Concept](/docs/meshname-other-concept) for details.
```

### Transclusion Resolution

Embeds are expanded into blockquotes:

```markdown
# Source
![Important Point](/docs/important-point)

# Built output
> **Important Point**
>
> The actual content from the Important Point note...
```

## Integration

### From Mesh

Export manifests reference Mesh notes via wiki-links:

```markdown
Include these concepts:
[Core Concepts](/docs/core-concepts)
[Advanced Patterns](/docs/advanced-patterns)
[Best Practices](/docs/best-practices)
```

Order matters - notes are compiled in the order listed.

### With Imports

Other Flints can import your exports. Structure exports with consumers in mind - clear naming, focused bundles.

## Output Format

Currently, Exports outputs markdown files only. The files have:
- Frontmatter stripped or preserved based on configuration
- Embeds expanded
- Wiki-links rewritten with prefixes

## Best Practices

**Design exports for your audience.** A guide for humans differs from a bundle for other Flints. Know who's consuming.

**Keep manifests updated.** When you add notes to a series, update the export manifest.

**Test your exports.** Read the compiled output. Broken links, missing context, and ordering issues only show up in the final artifact.

**Version your bundles.** When creating exports for other Flints, note the version in the manifest description.

### Manifest Patterns

Simple sequential:
```markdown
[Chapter 1](/docs/chapter-1)
[Chapter 2](/docs/chapter-2)
[Chapter 3](/docs/chapter-3)
```

With sections:
```markdown
## Part 1: Foundations
[Core Concepts](/docs/core-concepts)
[Basic Usage](/docs/basic-usage)

## Part 2: Advanced
[Advanced Patterns](/docs/advanced-patterns)
[Integration](/docs/integration)
```

### Common Mistakes

- **Circular transclusions** - Note A embeds Note B embeds Note A. Compiler detects this.
- **Missing notes** - Manifest references a note that doesn't exist. Check for typos.
- **Order confusion** - Wiki-link lists compile in order. Reorganize the list, not the files.
- **Giant single exports** - Split into logical chunks. Nobody wants a 100-page single file.
