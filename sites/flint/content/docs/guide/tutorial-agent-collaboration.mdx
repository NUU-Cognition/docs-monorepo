Learn how to work effectively with AI agents in your Flint.

## What We'll Cover

- Setting up for agent collaboration
- Teaching agents your workspace
- Using plugins for structured work
- Best practices for human-agent workflow

## Step 1: Install the Claude Code Mod

Edit `flint.toml`:

```toml
[flint]
name = "my-project"
type = "flint"

[plugins]
required = [
  "living-documents",
  "increments",
  "flint-terminal-agent"
]

[mods]
required = ["git", "claude-code"]
```

```bash
flint sync
```

This installs the Flint Terminal Agent plugin (agent conventions) and the Claude Code mod (tool integration).

## Step 2: Prepare Your Init File

The init file is how agents understand your workspace. Make it comprehensive:

```markdown
---
id: (auto-generated)
tags:
  - "#system"
---

# My Project

A workspace for [describe your project].

## Purpose

[2-3 sentences about what this Flint is for]

## Current Focus

- Active increment: [Increment 1.0.0 - Foundation](/docs/increment-1-0-0-foundation)
- Key tasks: [Task User Auth](/docs/task-user-auth), [Task API Design](/docs/task-api-design)

## Key Documents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [(Dashboard) Backlog](/docs/dashboard-backlog) | All planned work |
| [(Dashboard) Increments](/docs/dashboard-increments) | Release tracking |
| [Architecture](/docs/architecture) | System design |

## Plugins

| Plugin | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Living Document | Track document lifecycle |
| Increments | Version releases |
| Flint Terminal Agent | Agent conventions |

## Agent Instructions

When working in this Flint:
1. Check current increment for priorities
2. Update task status as you work
3. Follow existing naming conventions
4. Ask before major architectural changes

## Workspace

Codebase linked at [Workspace/Monorepo](/docs/workspace-monorepo)
```

## Step 3: Start an Agent Session

When you start Claude Code (or another AI agent) in your Flint:

**First message pattern:**

```
Read Mesh/(System) Flint Init.md to understand this workspace.
Then help me with [your task].
```

The agent will read the init file and have context for everything that follows.

## Step 4: Use Plugins for Structured Work

### Creating a Task

```
Read @Plugins/Projects/init-proj.md and create a new task for
implementing user notifications.
```

The agent will:
1. Read the Projects plugin init file
2. Follow the task template
3. Create a properly structured task document

### Archiving Completed Work

```
Use @Plugins/Archive/skills/sk-arc-archive.md to archive the
completed authentication task.
```

The agent will:
1. Read the archive skill
2. Move the task to Archive/
3. Update relevant dashboards

### Creating an Increment

```
Read @Plugins/Increments/init-inc.md and create increment 2.0.0
for the notification system.
```

## Step 5: Establish Conventions

Document your preferences in the init file:

```markdown
## Conventions

### Naming
- Tasks: `(Task) Verb Noun.md`
- Concepts: `Noun Phrase.md`
- System files: `(System) Name.md`

### Tags
- `#task` - Actionable items
- `#concept` - Ideas and definitions
- `#ld/living` - Active documents
- `#ld/dead` - Archived documents

### Workflow
1. Tasks start in Backlog
2. Active tasks get `status: active`
3. Done tasks move to Archive
```

Agents will follow these conventions when creating documents.

## Step 6: Multi-Session Continuity

Agents start fresh each session. To maintain continuity:

### Session Notes

Create a session note at start:

```markdown
# Session 2025-12-18

## Context

Continuing work from yesterday:
- Completed: [Task User Auth](/docs/task-user-auth)
- In progress: [Task API Design](/docs/task-api-design)
- Blocked: Waiting on design review

## Goals Today

1. Finish API endpoint specs
2. Start database migration
3. Update architecture doc

## Notes

[Agent adds notes during session]
```

### Handoff Pattern

End sessions with a summary:

```
Summarize what we accomplished and what's pending.
Update the relevant dashboards and create a handoff note.
```

## Step 7: Effective Prompting

### Good Patterns

**Grounded in context:**
```
Looking at [Task API Design](/docs/task-api-design), what's the best approach
for the authentication endpoints?
```

**Plugin-aware:**
```
Use the Increments plugin to update our 1.0.0 increment
with today's completed tasks.
```

**Convention-following:**
```
Create a concept note for "Rate Limiting" following our
existing naming conventions.
```

### Patterns to Avoid

**Vague scope:**
```
Help me with the project.  ❌
```

**Context-free:**
```
Write some API documentation.  ❌
```

**Better:**
```
Read [Architecture](/docs/architecture) and [Task API Design](/docs/task-api-design), then write
API documentation for the auth endpoints.  ✓
```

## Agent Capabilities by Plugin

| Plugin | What Agents Can Do |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Core** | Navigate, search, create notes |
| **Living Document** | Track status, manage lifecycle |
| **Increments** | Create/update version releases |
| **Projects** | Manage tasks and backlog |
| **Archive** | Move completed items |
| **Notepad** | Quick capture of ideas |

Load the relevant plugin init before asking for plugin-specific work.

## Workflow: Daily Agent Session

```
# Morning
1. "Read the init file and check (Dashboard) Backlog"
2. "What's the status of our current increment?"
3. "Let's work on [task]"

# During work
4. Agent creates/updates notes
5. Agent uses plugins as needed
6. Human reviews, provides feedback

# End of day
7. "Update task statuses based on our work"
8. "Create a session summary"
9. Human commits changes
```

## Troubleshooting

### Agent seems confused

```
Re-read Mesh/(System) Flint Init.md and tell me what you
understand about this workspace.
```

### Agent not following conventions

```
Look at the existing (Task) files in Mesh/ and follow that
exact format for the new task.
```

### Agent context seems lost

```
Let's start fresh. Read the init file again, then
check our current increment status.
```
