# Quick Start

This guide will help you install Flint and create your first workspace.

## Installation

Install Flint using our install script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NUU-Cognition/flint/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Create a Workspace

Create your first Flint workspace:

```bash
flint init my-workspace
cd my-workspace
```

This creates a new directory with the standard Flint structure.
