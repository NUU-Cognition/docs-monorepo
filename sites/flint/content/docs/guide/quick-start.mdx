Get from zero to a working Flint workspace in minutes.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** installed
- **pnpm** package manager
- **Terminal access**
- **Text editor** (VS Code, Obsidian, or any markdown editor)

## Step 1: Install the CLI

Flint CLI is part of a monorepo. To set up for local development:

```bash
# Clone the monorepo
git clone https://github.com/nuu-cognition/main.git
cd main

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build packages
pnpm build

# Link CLI globally
cd apps/flint-cli
pnpm link --global
```

Verify installation:

```bash
flint --version
```

## Step 2: Create a Flint

```bash
flint init my-research
```

This creates the folder structure:

```
(Flint) my-research/
├── flint.toml           # Configuration file
├── .flint/              # Runtime data (gitignored)
├── Mesh/                # Your notes go here
│   └── (System) Flint Init.md
├── Imports/             # External Flint content
├── Exports/             # Compiled outputs
├── Workspace/           # External resource links
├── Media/               # Images and files
└── Plugins/             # Automation capabilities
```

Additional folders are created on-demand:
- `Connections/` - When you add a connection to another Flint
- `Subflints/` - When you create nested Flint workspaces

## Step 3: Navigate to Your Flint

```bash
cd "(Flint) my-research"
```

## Step 4: Read the Init File

Open `Mesh/(System) Flint Init.md`. This file explains:
- What this Flint is for
- How it's organized
- What plugins are installed

Every agent session should start by reading this file.

## Step 5: Create Your First Note

Create a file in `Mesh/`:

```markdown
# My First Concept

This is my first note in Flint.

It can link to [Other Notes](/docs/other-notes) using wiki-style links.

Tags go in frontmatter or inline like #draft.
```

Save as `Mesh/My First Concept.md`.

## Step 6: Index Your Files

```bash
flint sync
```

This:
- Adds unique IDs to files without them
- Updates the index in `.flint/`
- Syncs installed plugins and mods

## Step 7: Query Your Notes

```bash
mesh query --tag "#draft"
```

## You're Done!

You now have a working Flint workspace. Here's what to do next:

### Open in an Editor

```bash
flint open           # Opens in configured apps
```

Or open the folder directly in VS Code or Obsidian.

### Add Plugins

Edit `flint.toml`:

```toml
[plugins]
required = [
  "core",
  "living-documents",
  "increments"
]
```

Then sync:

```bash
flint sync
```

### Link a Codebase

```bash
flint workspace reference monorepo /path/to/your/code
```

### Create More Notes

Every note in `Mesh/` is automatically indexed. Use `[links](/docs/links)` to connect them.

## Essential Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `flint init <name>` | Create a new Flint |
| `flint sync` | Sync config, plugins, index |
| `flint open` | Open in configured apps |
| `mesh index` | Index Mesh files |
| `mesh query --tag X` | Find notes by tag |
| `mesh compile <note>` | Compile with transclusions |
| `flint plugin list` | Show installed plugins |
| `flint repair` | Fix common issues |

## File Format Quick Reference

Every markdown file can have YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
id: auto-generated-uuid
tags:
  - "#concept"
  - "#draft"
---

# Note Title

Content with [wiki links](/docs/wiki-links) and ![embeds](/docs/embeds).
```

The `id` is auto-generated by `flint sync`. Tags can also be written inline as `#tag`.

## Common Naming Patterns

- `(System) Name.md` - Configuration and navigation
- `(Dashboard) Name.md` - Overview documents
- `(Task) Name.md` - Actionable work items
- `Name.md` - Regular concept notes
