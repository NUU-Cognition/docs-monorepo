title: "Quick Start: Your First Flint"
---

Get from zero to a working Flint workspace.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** - Check with `node --version`
- **macOS or Linux** (Windows users: use WSL)
- **Obsidian** (optional but recommended) - For the best editing experience

## Step 1: Install the CLI

Install Flint using the install script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NUU-Cognition/flint/main/install.sh | bash
```

This downloads the latest release and installs it to `~/.nuucognition/flint/`.

Verify installation:

```bash
flint --version
```

### Update

To update to the latest version, run the same command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NUU-Cognition/flint/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Uninstall

```bash
rm -rf ~/.nuucognition/flint
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/flint  # or ~/.local/bin/flint
```

Your data (`~/.flint/`) is preserved.

## Step 2: Create Your First Flint

Navigate to where you want your workspace and create a new Flint:

```bash
flint init "My Project"
```

This creates the folder `(Flint) My Project/` with the essential structure.

**Using a preset** (recommended for new users):

```bash
flint init "My Project" --preset default
```

The `default` preset includes common plugins like projects, increments, and notepad.

## Step 3: Explore the Structure

Navigate into your new Flint:

```bash
cd "(Flint) My Project"
```

Here's what was created:

```
(Flint) My Project/
├── flint.toml           # Configuration file
├── flint.lock           # Computed state (auto-generated)
├── .flint/              # Runtime data (gitignored)
├── Mesh/                # Your notes go here
│   └── (System) Flint Init.md
├── Imports/             # Content from other Flints
├── Exports/             # Compiled outputs for sharing
├── Workspace/           # Links to external resources
├── Media/               # Images, PDFs, assets
└── Plugins/             # Automation capabilities
```

If you used `--preset default`, you'll also see plugins installed in `Plugins/`.

## Step 4: Read the Init File

Open `Mesh/(System) Flint Init.md` in any text editor. This file:

- Explains what this Flint is for
- Describes the folder structure
- Lists installed plugins
- Provides guidance for AI agents working in this space

Every time you (or an AI agent) starts working in a Flint, reading the init file first ensures you understand the workspace context.

## Step 5: Open in Obsidian

For the best editing experience, open your Flint folder directly in Obsidian as a vault:

1. Open Obsidian
2. Click "Open folder as vault"
3. Select your `(Flint) My Project/` folder

Flint's conventions (wiki-links, YAML frontmatter, folder structure) are fully compatible with Obsidian's features.

## Step 6: Create Your First Note

Create a file in `Mesh/`. You can use the command line, your editor, or Obsidian.

Example note at `Mesh/Project Ideas.md`:

```markdown
---
id: auto-generated-by-sync
tags:
  - "#brainstorm"
---

# Project Ideas

Initial thoughts for the project.

## Mobile App

A mobile companion would help with [On-the-Go Access](/on-the-go-access).

## Integration

Consider connecting to [External Services](/external-services).
```

Key concepts:
- **Frontmatter** - YAML at the top with metadata
- **Wiki links** - `[Note Name](/note-name)` links to other notes
- **Tags** - Use `#tag` format in frontmatter or inline
- **IDs** - Auto-generated by sync (unique identifiers)

## Step 7: Sync Your Workspace

Run sync to update the workspace state:

```bash
flint sync
```

Sync performs several operations:
- Adds unique IDs to files that don't have them
- Installs/updates plugins declared in `flint.toml`
- Updates the index in `.flint/`

**Run sync regularly** - after adding notes, changing configuration, or when plugins need updating.

## Step 8: Basic Workflows

### Add Plugins

Edit `flint.toml` to add plugins:

```toml
[flint]
name = "My Project"
type = "flint"

[plugins]
required = [
  "core",
  "living-documents",
  "increments",
  "projects"
]
```

Then sync to install them:

```bash
flint sync
```

### List Installed Plugins

```bash
flint plugin list
```

To see all available plugins:

```bash
flint plugin list --available
```

### Link a Codebase

If your Flint relates to a codebase, create a workspace reference:

```bash
flint workspace add monorepo --type codebase
flint workspace fulfill monorepo /path/to/your/code
```

This creates `Workspace/References/rf-monorepo.md` documenting the link.

### Index Your Notes

To manually rebuild the index:

```bash
flint index
```

This scans all markdown files and updates `.flint/index.json`.

## Essential Commands Reference

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `flint init <name>` | Create a new Flint |
| `flint sync` | Sync config, plugins, index |
| `flint list` | List registered Flints |
| `flint index` | Rebuild the index |
| `flint plugin list` | Show installed plugins |
| `flint plugin list --available` | Show available plugins |
| `flint repair` | Fix common issues |
| `flint --help` | See all commands |

## File Naming Conventions

Flint uses typed prefixes to indicate document purpose:

| Pattern | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `(System) *.md` | Configuration and navigation |
| `(Task) *.md` | Actionable work items |
| `(Dashboard) *.md` | Overview documents |
| `(Plan) *.md` | High-level plans |
| `(Increment) *.md` | Version work packages |
| `*.md` | Regular notes |

Example: `(Task) Implement Auth.md`, `(System) Flint Init.md`

## Troubleshooting

**"Command not found: flint"**
- Make sure the install completed successfully
- Check if `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH
- Try: `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`

**"Not inside a Flint"**
- Make sure you're in a folder with `flint.toml`
- Navigate into the `(Flint) Name/` folder, not its parent

**Obsidian doesn't see the folder**
- Use "Open folder as vault" in Obsidian
- Point it to the `(Flint) Name/` directory

**Sync shows errors**
- Run `flint repair` to fix common issues
- Check `flint.toml` for syntax errors
