Understanding these concepts will make everything else click.

## Bounded Cognitive Workspace

A Flint is a *bounded* workspace. It has clear edges - one folder containing everything related to a single domain of thought.

This is different from:
- A file system (infinite, unstructured)
- A database (infinite, but structured)
- A wiki (can sprawl indefinitely)

The boundary matters because:
1. **Comprehensibility** - You can understand the whole thing
2. **Portability** - You can move, share, or archive it as a unit
3. **Agent context** - An AI can read the init file and understand the scope

When a Flint gets too big or unfocused, split it. Create a new Flint and use Imports/Connections to link them.

## Modules

Flint organizes content into 8 modules, each with a specific purpose:

| Module | Purpose | Question it Answers |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| **Mesh** | Your thinking | What do I know/think? |
| **Imports** | External context | What do others know? |
| **Exports** | Shared outputs | What am I publishing? |
| **Workspace** | External reality | What am I modeling? |
| **Media** | Binary assets | What visuals support this? |
| **Plugins** | Automation | What can agents do here? |
| **Connections** | Messaging | Who am I coordinating with? |
| **Subflints** | Nested workspaces | What needs isolation? |

The mental model: **Mesh is the center**. Everything else either feeds into it (Imports, Workspace), flows out of it (Exports), supports it (Media, Plugins, Subflints), or coordinates around it (Connections).

## The Mesh: Notes as a Graph

Your notes in `Mesh/` aren't isolated files - they're nodes in a graph. When you write `[Other Note](/docs/other-note)`, you create an edge. When you write `![Embedded Content](/docs/embedded-content)`, you create a transclusion.

This graph enables:
- **Navigation** - Follow links between concepts
- **Discovery** - Find backlinks (what links *to* this?)
- **Compilation** - Resolve transclusions into complete documents

Think of Mesh as your external brain. Ideas go in as notes. Connections form through links. Insights emerge from the structure.

## Plugins: Cognitive Runtimes

Plugins extend what you (and agents) can do in a Flint. But they're not traditional code plugins - they're *prompt packages*.

A plugin contains:
- **Init file** - Context agents load to understand the plugin
- **Skills** - Repeatable tasks (archive a note, create an increment)
- **Templates** - Document structures (task spec, increment log)
- **Workflows** - Multi-step processes with human checkpoints

Plugins don't run code by default. They provide structured prompts that agents interpret. This makes them:
- Safe (no arbitrary code execution)
- Inspectable (it's all markdown)
- Portable (works with any capable agent)

Load plugins on demand. Don't load everything at session start - that wastes context.

## Mods: Root-Level Modifications

Mods modify how Flint itself works. Unlike plugins (which add agent capabilities), mods configure the system:

- **git mod** - Initializes git, manages `.gitignore`
- **claude-code mod** - Configures Claude Code integration

Mods are declared in `flint.toml` and installed via `flint sync`.

## Configuration Layers

Flint uses layered configuration:

1. **Global** - `~/.flint/config.toml` - User preferences (registry location)
2. **Workspace** - `flint.toml` - This Flint's configuration
3. **Lock** - `.flint/flint.lock` - Computed state (don't edit)

Most configuration lives in `flint.toml`:

```toml
[flint]
name = "my-project"
type = "flint"

[plugins]
required = [
  "living-documents",
  "increments"
]

[mods]
required = ["git"]
```

## Types and Presets

**Types** define what a note is for. Common types include:
- `note` - General purpose
- `task` - Actionable item
- `increment` - Versioned work package
- `system` - Configuration/navigation

Types are indicated by frontmatter (`type: task`) or naming convention (`(Task) Name.md`).

**Presets** are templates for common Flint configurations. Instead of configuring from scratch, you can base your Flint on a preset that includes plugins, mods, and conventions for a specific use case (research, software project, writing).

## The Flow

Here's how data typically flows through a Flint:

```
External World
     │
     ▼
┌─────────┐     ┌──────────┐
│Workspace│     │ Imports  │
│(reality)│     │(context) │
└────┬────┘     └────┬─────┘
     │               │
     └───────┬───────┘
             ▼
        ┌────────┐
        │  Mesh  │ ← Your thinking happens here
        │(notes) │
        └────┬───┘
             │
     ┌───────┼───────┐
     │       │       │
     ▼       ▼       ▼
┌───────┐ ┌──────┐ ┌───────────┐
│Exports│ │Media │ │Connections│
│(share)│ │(viz) │ │ (message) │
└───────┘ └──────┘ └───────────┘
             │
             ▼
      Other Flints / World
```

1. **Workspace** grounds you in reality (codebases, data)
2. **Imports** bring context from other Flints
3. **Mesh** is where you think and work
4. **Exports** publish your thinking
5. **Media** supports visualization
6. **Connections** coordinate with others

**Not shown in the flow diagram:**
- **Plugins** extend agent capabilities (they're tools, not data)
- **Subflints** are nested workspaces with their own complete structure

## Agent Mental Model

If you're an AI agent operating in a Flint:

1. **Start with init** - Read `Mesh/(System) Flint Init.md`
2. **Load plugins on demand** - Only what you need
3. **Work in Mesh** - That's where thinking happens
4. **Follow conventions** - Match existing naming patterns
5. **Use `mesh query`** - Find what you need
6. **Don't overreach** - Stay within the Flint's scope

The init file tells you everything you need to know about this specific workspace.

## Key Principles

1. **One domain per Flint** - When it sprawls, split it
2. **Modules have purposes** - Put things where they belong
3. **Links create meaning** - Connect your ideas
4. **Plugins are prompts** - Safe, inspectable, portable
5. **Agents are first-class** - The system is designed for AI collaboration
6. **Declare, don't code** - Configuration over programming
