title: "Tutorial: Research Notes with Flint"
---

Learn how to organize research, connect sources, and produce publications.

## What We'll Build

A research Flint with:
- Organized source materials
- Connected concept notes
- Literature synthesis
- Exportable papers

## Step 1: Create the Flint

```bash
flint init ai-safety-research
cd "(Flint) ai-safety-research"
```

Edit `flint.toml` to set the title if desired.

## Step 2: Configure for Research

Edit `flint.toml`:

```toml
[flint]
name = "ai-safety-research"
type = "flint"

[plugins]
required = [
  "living-documents",
  "notepad",
  "archive"
]

[mods]
required = ["git"]
```

```bash
flint sync
```

## Step 3: Set Up Source Organization

Create folders in `Mesh/`:

```
Mesh/
├── (System) Flint Init.md
├── (System) Index.md
├── Sources/           # Primary sources
├── Concepts/          # Key ideas
├── Syntheses/         # Your analysis
└── Drafts/            # Work in progress
```

## Step 4: Document Your Sources

Create `Mesh/Sources/Bostrom 2014 - Superintelligence.md`:

```markdown
---
id: (auto-generated)
tags:
  - "#source"
  - "#book"
---

# Superintelligence (Bostrom, 2014)

**Author:** Nick Bostrom
**Year:** 2014
**Type:** Book

## Key Claims

1. Superintelligent AI could emerge this century
2. Control problem is the central challenge
3. Value alignment is technically difficult

## Important Quotes

> "The first superintelligence may shape the future of Earth-originating life."
> — Chapter 1

> "A superintelligence could be the last invention humanity ever needs to make."
> — Chapter 2

## My Notes

Strong argument for taking AI safety seriously early.
The orthogonality thesis is particularly compelling.

## Step 5: Build Concept Notes

# Orthogonality Thesis

The claim that intelligence and goals are independent: a system
can be arbitrarily intelligent while pursuing any goal.

## Definition

"Intelligence and final goals are orthogonal: more or less any
level of intelligence could in principle be combined with more
or less any final goal." — Bostrom

## Implications

1. Smart doesn't mean benevolent
2. Can't assume advanced AI shares human values
3. Alignment must be engineered, not assumed

# Control Problem Overview

My synthesis of the AI control problem literature.

## The Core Challenge

Given the [Orthogonality Thesis](/orthogonality-thesis), we cannot assume advanced AI
will share human values. The control problem asks: how do we
ensure AI systems remain beneficial as they become more capable?

## Key Approaches

### 1. Corrigibility

Making AI systems that accept correction. Challenges include:
- Incentive to resist shutdown
- Preserving own goals

See [Concepts/Corrigibility](/concepts-corrigibility) for details.

### 2. Value Learning

Having AI infer human values through observation.

See [Concepts/Value Learning](/concepts-value-learning) for details.

### 3. Constitutional AI

Training with explicit principles. Anthropic's approach.

See [Sources/Bai 2022 - Constitutional AI](/sources-bai-2022-constitutional-ai).

## Open Questions

1. Can value learning scale to superintelligence?
2. Is corrigibility stable under self-improvement?
3. What happens with multiple competing AI systems?

## Step 7: Add Reference Materials

Store PDFs in `Media/`:

```
Media/
├── papers/
│   ├── bostrom-2014-superintelligence-excerpt.pdf
│   └── russell-2019-human-compatible-ch1.pdf
└── diagrams/
    └── control-problem-taxonomy.png
```

Reference them in notes:

```markdown

## Step 8: Use the Index

Create `Mesh/(System) Index.md`:

```markdown
---
id: (auto-generated)
tags:
  - "#system"
  - "#dashboard"
---

# Index

## Step 10: Export for Publication

Create `Exports/Survey.md` (the export manifest):

```markdown
---
id: (auto-generated)
description: Survey paper for publication

# Survey Paper Export

[Drafts/Control Problem Survey](/drafts-control-problem-survey)
```

Build:

```bash
flint export build Survey
```

The compiled paper appears in `Exports/Survey/` with all transclusions resolved.

## Research Workflow

2. Capture key claims and quotes
3. Link to relevant concepts
4. Add to Index

### When Thinking
